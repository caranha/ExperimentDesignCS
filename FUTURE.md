How I want to improve the course in the future:

# Remodularization of the material
Break down the PDFs (As well as the videos) more clearly into "topics" to
reduce the need of re-recording videos.

Avoid mixing time-sensitive materials (schedules, response to comments) with
time insensitive materials (topics).

# Case-based explanation
Re-read the blog below, and re-write the material to focus more in
"case-based" study.
