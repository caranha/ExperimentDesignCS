\begin{frame}[t]{Outline}
  In this lecture, we will continue studying the \structure{Null Hypothesis
  Statistical Testing}. \bigskip

  We will learn about two specific cases that are quite common in algorithm studies:\bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hypothesis testing on the difference between two treatments. ({\bf Comparison Testing})\medskip
    \item Hypothesis testing when there is a strong correlation factor between the observations of the two treatments. ({\bf Paired Testing})
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Treatments?}
    {\smaller
    The word "treatment" is from the medicine literature, but here we use to indicate two different things that we want to compare. It could be two algorithms, or two parameter settings, or two experimental conditions, etc.
