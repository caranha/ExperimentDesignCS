\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Outline}
  In the last lecture, we studied how to use \structure{Hypothesis Testing} to perform induction on the value of a population parameter based on an estimator obtained from the sample.\bigskip

  A common situation in scientific inquiry is the comparison between two different approaches:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A drug agains a control group;
    \item A new algorithm against an old one;
    \item Two alternatives for a website design;
    \item etc;
  \end{itemize}
  \bigskip

  In this lecture, we will study how to perform Hypothesis testing for the comparison of two samples;

\subsection{Pre-lecture Comments}

\begin{frame}{Comments on Report 01}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I gave a quick look at the reports, but the full grading will take a bit of time, so please be patient;
    \item In general, everyone did great reports, I am very happy with the results;
    \item However, there were some common mistakes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Many people did not include code for reproducibility; or the data used in the analysis; \alert{Non-reproducible reports will receive a lower grade}.
      \item A few students did not submit reports in PDF; \alert{The main file of the report MUST be a PDF}
      \item One student asked to use secret experimental data in the report; \alert{It is acceptable, but I recommend against it in the future};
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Questions from Students}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item From my experience, students normally have {\bf many questions} in this lecture; Specially after lecture 3;
    \item However, there was only one question by comment from a student, and only one question in manaba;
    \item I understand that it may be harder to ask questions in long distance learning, but if you don't understand a concept, please write a thread on manaba, the TA is there to help everyone.
  \end{itemize}
