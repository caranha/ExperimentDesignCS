\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}[t]{Outline}
  In this lecture, we study two more cases of \structure{Null Hypothesis
  Statistical Testing} that are quite common in experiments on algorithms:\bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hypothesis testing on the difference between two treatments. ({\bf Comparison Testing})\medskip
    \item Hypothesis testing when there is a strong correlation factor between the observations of the two treatments. ({\bf Paired Testing})
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Treatments?}
    {\smaller
    The word "treatment" is from the medicine literature, but here we use to indicate two different things that we want to compare. It could be two algorithms, or two parameter settings, or two experimental conditions, etc.
