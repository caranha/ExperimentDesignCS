# Topic 04: Comparison testing and Paired Testing

## TODO:
- [ ] Introduction:
  - [ ] Comments to the students
    - I will take some more time to grade the reports, please be patient
    - A quick look at the report showed that many people did not submit code, only the PDF. Please note that submission of code is mandatory!
    - One student only submitted code, no PDF. Please submit the PDF!
    - One student asked if it was okay to do a report on research data that cannot be shared. I accepted this report and will honor the request, but I would prefer if you did not do that.
    - The last class might be hard for students seeing the topic for the first time, please ask questions!
