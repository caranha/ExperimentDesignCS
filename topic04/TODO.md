# Topic 04: Comparison testing and Paired Testing
## Lecture Goals:
*TODO*


## TASKS:
## Future:
- [ ] Create Sections
  - Part I: Two Sample Testing
  - Part II: Paired testing
  - Part III: Outro

- [ ] Two Sample testing
  - Numerical calculation example (explain what alpha, beta, gamma means again)
  - Testing assumptions (remember to remember the assumptions)
  - Extra: different variance case
  - Summary: If we can model both processes as normals,

- [ ] Paired Testing
  - Add motivating examples in the beginning of section
  - Add counter examples (when NOT to pair) at the end.

- [ ] Algorithm case study:
  - Discussion: What is the sample of interest? What are observations?
    - Problem instances
    - Repetitions on the same problem
  - Problem instance, Problem, Problem family, "any problem"

- [ ] Outro
  - Reminder about calendar
  - Reminders about reports
    - PDF format
    - Report, not a collection of code and images.
      - Description of the experiment
      - Data gathering
      - Analysis
      - Conclusion
    - Reproducibility
    - Some report examples
  - Comments from Surveys
  - Code examples
