# TODO

## Make Code sample for this lecture (TA?)
- In the code sample, comment with the important of defining and framing
    the experiment before experimental analysis begins

- For example "Find the drying time of shirts outdoors vs indoors" against
  "Which is faster, drying shirts indoors or outdoors"
  - The first one leads to more curiosity: What is the range of times for each factor, how much is the difference for each factor. The second one kills curiosity: Which one is faster? Done!
  - The second one is "clicky-baity" - click-bait can be good for attracting attention, but we must not fool OURSELVES with click bait.
  - I probably need to say this earlier.

- Framing the experiment before defining the analysis is better because we don't
need to contort the experiment factors and objectives to fit the analysis.

## Add a more gentle explanation (with more numbers) about distribution curves, percentiles, etc.

## Future:
When do we talk about isolating experimental factors in a more formal way?
- Blocking, randomization, etc.

## Remove Outro from main slides into a spearate thing (maybe separate folder)
