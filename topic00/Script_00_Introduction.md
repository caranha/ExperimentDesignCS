Hello everyone, my name is Claus Aranha, and this is
"Experiment Designs for Computer Sciences". Welcome to the course.

In this first video, I want to explain to you the goals of this course, and how we are going to study in it.

==

So let's get started. The main objective of this course is described in the syllabus: "To Study the General Philosophy and Methods Behind Experimentalism."

Okay, but what does this mean?

==

If I were to explain this course in one sentence, I would say that we are going to learn how to do an experiment in a *systematic manner*.

One way to look at it, is to think about the PDCA paradigm of industry: Plan, Do, Check and Act.

So I want to teach you to think of a scientific experiment in the same way: First you plan your experiment carefully. Then you Execute your experiment following that plan. Then you verify the results of your experiment. And, finally, you act on these results, you progress your research or maybe write a paper or a thesis.

==

What is the motivation for this course?

One of the reasons that I teach this course, is that there are some mistakes that I see over and over again in Computer Science experiments.

For example, experiment that do not control for "coincidences" (noise factors).

Experiments that do unfair comparisons between methods.

Experiments that are not reproducible, or not clear. Etc.

Most of these errors happen because the experiment is done in a careless manner, without thinking too much about it.

So I want to teach that if you are not a bit careful about your experiments, many serious errors can happen.

==

Another objective in this course is to talk about what some people call the "invisible curriculum" of academia.

When you are in a Computer Science Master degree, you learn a lot about programming, and systems, and that is really fun. But there is also a lot of things that are important for a researcher, and it is not really clear when or how you should learn about them.

This is the "invisible curriculum". Things like "How do I prepare and experiment", or "When do I write a paper", or "how do I review a paper", "how do I teach?"

So another goal of this course is to try to teach you a bit about this "invisible curriculum". And that also means that I'm always available to talk about any of these topics or other topics that you feel unsure during your graduate student life.

==

This course is divided in two main topics.

The first one is to define how we should think of experiments.

So we will talk about the role of an experiment in science, and
also how we design experiment to answer specific questions.

During the course we will try to define how to prepare GOOD
experiments, and how to analyze their results.

This analysis part takes us to the second main topic,
which are the statistical tools that we use to analyze an experiment.

We will start with some very basic statistical concepts that
are very useful, such as confidence intervals.

Then we will dive into some concepts that you probably
have heard before, which are statistical tests.

This is an area where a lot of people try to imitate what
other researcher do without thinking too much about it,
so I want to try and give you a solid base to avoid those mistakes.

So we are going to talk about what it really means for
a result to be "statistically significant", and what
are some key concepts such as paired tests, sample size,
and experiment power.

==

Now, it is also important to talk about the limitations of this
course.

Statistical analysis of experiments is a very wide topic.
There are entire books about the many statistical tools that exist.

Also, each kind of experiment, each kind of research, will
require different experimental designs, experimental protocols,
and statistical tools.

For example, if you are doing a research that involves
interviewing people about an interface, the way that you
will prepare and analyze your experiment will be very different
than if your research was about measuring the speed-up of
a parallel processing system.

So my goal in this course is to give you a solid base, that
you can use to study the specific experiment and statistical
tools that you need for your own research.

What do you need to pay attention when you're doing a
statistical analysis?

How do you count the number of variables of your experiment?

Each experiment is different, and you will need to learn
that on your own, but also there are some common ideas,
some common concepts, that I want to teach you here.

By the way, if you have questions about how the ideas
in this class need to adapt to your research, I am always
happy to talk to you about this with you.
