    Part I -- What is this course about?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}

  \begin{block}{From the syllabus}
  \emph{The collection and analysis of data through experiments is one of the cornerstones of the scientific method. In this course, we study the general philosophy and methods behind experimentalism: Why do we perform experiments, what is a good/rigorous experiment, how to plan and design a rigorous experiment, and how to perform statistical analysis on experimental data.}
  \end{block}
  \bigskip

  What does this mean?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}{}

  The key idea of this course is to learn \structure{how to do an experiment in a systematic manner}.\bigskip

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../img/irasutoya_pdca}\ppagenote{PDCA flowchart from \url{https://www.irasutoya.com}}
  \end{center}\bigskip

  i.e., "how to apply the PDCA cycle for science?"
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why is this course necessary?}{Frequent errors when designing an experiment}

  There are some errors that are often found in CS experiments:
  \bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The experiment does control for noise;\\
      \structure{Problem: Is the result just a coincidence?}
    \item The experiment does unfair comparisons between methods;\\
      \structure{Problem: Is the result valid in the general case?}
    \item The experiment is not clear / not reproducible;\\
      \structure{Problem: Can this experiment help other people?}
    \item etc...
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  Many of these errors happen because of experiments done carelessly. So let's learn to think more carefully about them!


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why is this course necessary?}{The "Invisible Curriculum" -- things that are not taught in classes}

  The \structure{Invisible Curriculum} are things that are necessary for your work as an academic, but that you usually can't learn in a lecture, and must discover by \alert{trial and error}. For example:\bigskip

  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.7\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item How do I prepare an experiment?
      \item When do I publish a result?
      \item How do I review a paper?
      \item How do I teach a lecture?
      \item What are grants?
      \item ...
    \end{itemize}\bigskip

    The goal of this course is to shed light in one of these points:\\
    \emph{What is an experiment, and how do I prepare it?}

  \end{columns}
  \bigskip

\end{frame}

\section{Course Topics}
\begin{frame}{Course Topics}
  The main things that you will learn in this course are:\bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is an experiment:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What is the role of an experiment in Science?
      \item How do I design an experiment to answer a scientific question?
      \item What are the characteristics of a \structure{good} experiment?
      \item How do I analyse the results of an experiment?
    \end{itemize}\bigskip

    \item Statistical tools for analyzing experimental data:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basic statistics for data analysis and visualization;
      \item Statistical Inference ("Statistically Significant Results");
      \item Statistical testing for single, paired, and multiple sample testing;
      \item How to calculate the sample size and power of an experiment;
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course Topics}{Limitations: This is only an introductory course!}

  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.8\textwidth}
    This course is an \structure{introduction} to design of experiment. My main objective is to teach you {\bf why} designing experiments is important, and what problems can happen when you don't do this. Not to teach all the statistical tests.
    %\column{0.1\textwidth}
    \column{0.2\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../img/irasuto_sprout}
      \ppagenote{Sprout image from \url{https://www.irasutoya.com}}
  \end{columns}
  \vfill

  Each experiment, in each research, will require a different way of doing statistical analysis. Also, some advanced topics (bayesian statistical analysis) will not be covered here. I hope that after this course you will have a solid understanding of the concepts to read and learn the advanced tests required of your own research.

    Part III - Report I
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Report I}{General Information}
  Write a "mini paper" about an experiment that you choose, prepare, execute and analyze. Specifically, you must:\medskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a question to investigate using a scientific experiment.
    \item Design the experiment (choose variables, data collection and analysis protocol)
    \item Execute the experiment following the data collection protocol.
    \item Analyze the data obtained following the data analysis protocol.
    \item Take note of any surprising or unsurprising findings, and prepare a conclusion for the experiment.
  \end{itemize}\medskip

  The report must summarize the above points (the question, experiment designs, data collection, data analysis, and conclusion).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Report I}{Expectations}
  In the first report, you should select a simple experiment with a single dependent variable and a single independent variable, and calculate simple statistical intervals of values observed for the dependent variable. These topics are covered in lectures 1 and 2.\smallskip

  The report will be graded by:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Whether it describes a coherent scientific experiment to answer the chosen question;
    \item The quality of the data analysis;
    \item The quality of the result presentation and discussion;
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

\alert{Note that you are NOT expected to use the null-hypothesis model in this report (lectures 4-6). Doing the test wrongly may deduct points.}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Report I}{How to choose an experiment topic}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If possible, choose something from your own research;
    \medskip

    \item Experiments from your day to day life are also good;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Comparing cooking techniques is always fun;
      \item When collecting data, be careful of measuring errors;
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    \item When in doubt, comparing algorithms is an easy choice;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Make sure to choose an appropriate metric to report!
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    \item Make sure you choose an experiment that you can perform!
    \bigskip

    \item This article might be insightful: \url{https://williamghunter.net/articles/101-ways-to-design-an-experiment}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Report 1}{Rules and Deadlines}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Report Deadline: 05/02, 23:00} -- submit on manaba\bigskip

    \item The report must be in English.\bigskip

    \item Submit the report as a PDF file, don't forget your name/ID.
    \item Submit also a ZIP file with all the data/scripts necessary to reproduce your analysis.
    \bigskip

    \item Plagiarism will be severely punished.
