\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}

  \begin{block}{From the (old) syllabus}
    \emph{The collection and analysis of data through experiments is
      one of the cornerstones of the scientific method. In this
      course, we study the general philosophy and methods behind
      experimentalism: Why do we perform experiments, what is a
      good/rigorous experiment, how to plan and design a rigorous
      experiment, and how to perform statistical analysis on
      experimental data.}
  \end{block}
  \bigskip

  TL;DR: In this course we study {\bf Experiments}, in the context of computer science.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}{Systematic experiments}

  The key idea of this course is to learn \structure{how to do an
    experiment in a systematic manner}.\bigskip

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../img/irasutoya_pdca}\ppagenote{PDCA flowchart from \url{https://www.irasutoya.com}}
  \end{center}\bigskip

  i.e., "how to apply the PDCA cycle for science?"
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why is this course necessary?}{Frequent errors when designing an experiment}

  There are some errors that are often found in CS experiments:
  \bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The experiment does control for noise;\\
      \structure{Problem: Is the result just a coincidence?}
    \item The experiment does unfair comparisons between methods;\\
      \structure{Problem: Is the result valid in the general case?}
    \item The experiment is not clear / not reproducible;\\
      \structure{Problem: Can this experiment help other people?}
    \item etc...
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  Many of these errors happen because of experiments done
  carelessly.\\
  So let's learn to think more carefully about them!

% \begin{frame}{Why is this course necessary?}{The "Invisible
%     Curriculum" -- things that are not taught in classes}

%   The \structure{Invisible Curriculum} are things that are necessary
%   for your work as an academic, but that you usually can't learn in a
%   lecture, and must discover by \alert{trial and error}. For
%   example:\bigskip

%   \begin{columns}
%     \column{0.7\textwidth}
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item How do I prepare an experiment?
%       \item When do I publish a result?
%       \item How do I review a paper?
%       \item How do I teach a lecture?
%       \item What are grants?
%       \item ...
%     \end{itemize}\bigskip

%     The goal of this course is to shed light in one of these points:\\
%     \emph{What is an experiment, and how do I prepare it?}

\section{Course Topics}
\begin{frame}{Course Topics}
  The main things that you will learn in this course are:\bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is an experiment:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What is the role of an experiment in Science?
      \item How do I design an experiment to answer a scientific question?
      \item What are the characteristics of a \structure{good} experiment?
      \item How do I analyse the results of an experiment?
    \end{itemize}\bigskip

    \item Statistical tools for analyzing experimental data:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basic statistics for data analysis and visualization;
      \item Statistical Inference ("Statistically Significant Results");
      \item Statistical testing for single, paired, and multiple sample testing;
      \item How to calculate the sample size and power of an experiment;
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course Topics}{Limitations: This is only an introductory course! Complement with your own study.}

  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.8\textwidth}
    This course is an \structure{introduction} to design of
    experiment. My main objective is to teach you {\bf why} designing
    experiments is important, and what problems can happen when you
    don't do this. Not to teach all the statistical tests.

  \end{columns}
  \vfill

  Each experiment, in each research, will require a different way of
  doing statistical analysis. Also, some advanced topics (bayesian
  statistical analysis) will not be covered here. I hope that after
  this course you will have a solid understanding of the concepts to
  read and learn the advanced tests required of your own research.

\begin{frame}[t]{Communication Channels}{}
  Talking to your professors is important. Do not leave questions unanswered!\bigskip

  Communication channels by priority:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Ask questions during the class. {\bf There is always time left at the end of the class}, so feel free to interrupt, or write your questions to ask after the class.
  \item Use the manaba forums to ask questions outside of class
    hours. By opening a forum thread, other students with similar
    questions can also see the answer.
  \item Feel free to e-mail me if you have questions that can not be
    shared with other students.
  \end{enumerate}\bigskip

  Also, every lecture I post an {\bf Attendance Survey} on manaba.\\
  The survey is not graded, but \alert{you must take the survey to count
    for attendance!}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Course Materials}
\begin{frame}[t]{Course Materials}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The lecture notes are published in the "manaba" system.
  \item Access code for 2024: \alert{3339466}. Use this code if you can't access manaba yet.
    \bigskip

  \item The course materials are also available on github:\\
    \url{https://caranha.github.io/ExperimentDesignCS/}.\medskip
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Note: The materials on github may be outdated. The version in manaba is the official version of the materials.
    \end{itemize}

  % \item This year, the course is fully in person. I strongly recommend
  %   that you come to class. However, the videos from 2022 will be
  %   listed on Manaba if you need to miss a lecture.
  %   \begin{itemize}
  %   \item Please note that there may be new material not covered in the videos.

  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Report I}{General Information}
  Write a "mini paper" about an experiment that you choose, prepare, execute and analyze. Specifically, you must:\medskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a question to investigate using a scientific experiment.
    \item Design the experiment (choose variables, data collection and analysis protocol)
    \item Execute the experiment following the data collection protocol.
    \item Analyze the data obtained following the data analysis protocol.
    \item Take note of any surprising or unsurprising findings, and prepare a conclusion for the experiment.
  \end{itemize}\medskip

  The report must summarize the above points (the question, experiment designs, data collection, data analysis, and conclusion).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Report I}{Expectations}
  In the first report, you should select a simple experiment with a single dependent variable and a single independent variable, and calculate simple statistical intervals of values observed for the dependent variable. These topics are covered in lectures 1 and 2.\smallskip

  The report will be graded by:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Whether it describes a coherent scientific experiment to answer the chosen question;
    \item The quality of the data analysis;
    \item The quality of the result presentation and discussion;
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

\alert{Note that you are NOT expected to use the null-hypothesis model in this report (lectures 4-6). Doing the test wrongly may deduct points.}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Report I}{How to choose an experiment topic}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If possible, choose something from your own research;
    \medskip

    \item Experiments from your day to day life are also good;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Comparing cooking techniques is always fun;
      \item When collecting data, be careful of measuring errors;
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    \item When in doubt, comparing algorithms is an easy choice;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Make sure to choose an appropriate metric to report!
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    \item Make sure you choose an experiment that you can perform!
