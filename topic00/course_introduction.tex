\section{Course Motivation}
\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}

  \begin{block}{From the syllabus}
  \emph{The collection and analysis of data through experiments is one of the cornerstones of the scientific method. In this course, we study the general philosophy and methods behind experimentalism: Why do we perform experiments, what is a good/rigorous experiment, how to plan and design a rigorous experiment, and how to perform statistical analysis on experimental data.}
  \end{block}
  \bigskip

  ... {\bf TL;DR?}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}{TL;DR; (Too Long, Didn't Read)}

  The key idea of this course is to learn how to \structure{plan, execute, analyse and interpret} a scientific experiment.\bigskip

  Another way to think is: "Experiment Design" is how to apply the PDCA cycle for science.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}{Why is a course on "Experiment Design" necessary?}
  There are some common errors that I see from students many times:
  \bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The experiment does control for noise factors;\\
      \structure{Is the result just a coincidence?}
    \item The experiment that compare two methods is not fair;\\
      \structure{Is the new method really better than the old one?}
    \item The experiment is not reproducible;\\
      \structure{How can this experiment help other people?}
    \item The conditions and assumptions of the experiment are not clear;\\
      \structure{The results and conclusions are questionable}
    \item etc...
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}{The "Dark Curriculum"}

  The \structure{Dark Curriculum} are things that are necessary for your work as an academic, but that you usually can't learn in a lecture, and must discover by \alert{trial and error}. For example:\bigskip

  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.7\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item How do I prepare an experiment?
      \item When do I publish a result?
      \item How do I review a paper?
      \item How do I teach a lecture?
      \item What are grants?
      \item ...
    \end{itemize}\bigskip

    The goal of this course is to shed light in one of these points:\\
    \emph{What is an experiment, and how do I prepare it?}.\bigskip

    \column{0.3\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../img/irasutoya_cave}\ppagenote{Cave illustration from \url{https://www.irasutoya.com}}
  \end{columns}
  \bigskip

\end{frame}

\section{Course Topics}
\begin{frame}{Course Topics}
  The main things that you will learn in this course are:\bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is an experiment:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What is the role of an experiment in Science?
      \item How do I design an experiment to answer a scientific question?
      \item What are the characteristics of a \structure{good} experiment?
      \item How do I analyse the results of an experiment?
    \end{itemize}\bigskip

    \item Statistical tools for analyzing experimental data:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basic statistics for data analysis and visualization;
      \item Statistical Inference ("Statistically Significant Results");
      \item Statistical testing for single, paired, and multiple sample testing;
      \item How to calculate the sample size and power of an experiment;
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course Topics}{Limitations: This is only an introductory course!}

  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.8\textwidth}
    This course is an \structure{introduction} to design of experiment. My main objective is to teach you {\bf why} designing experiments is important, and what problems can happen when you don't do this. Not to teach all the statistical tests.
    %\column{0.1\textwidth}
    \column{0.2\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../img/irasuto_sprout}
      \ppagenote{Sprout image from \url{https://www.irasutoya.com}}
  \end{columns}
  \vfill

  Each experiment, in each research, will require a different way of doing statistical analysis. Also, some advanced topics (bayesian statistical analysis) will not be covered here. I hope that after this course you will have a solid understanding of the concepts to read and learn the advanced tests required of your own research.

\end{frame}

\subsection{Course Format}
\begin{frame}{Course Format (Fri, 15:15 to 18:00)}
  \begin{block}{Online (On demand) Format}
    Video lectures and lecture notes published on manaba by the official lecture time. Please read the video lecture in full, at the time of your preference.
    \bigskip

    During the official lecture time, I will hold "office hours" on TEAMS. A link will be on manaba (I hope! :-)).
  \end{block}

  \begin{alertblock}{Two Exceptions:}
    Last class (06/18) is an online presentation of the final report. If you have problems with live presentation (time zones, etc), lemme know.\bigskip

    Final exam (06/25) will be live (online or in person, depends on covid situation in June). Tell me if you have timezone problems.
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course Format}{Student / Teacher communication}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \structure{Office hours}: Friday, 15:15-18:00, TEAMs meeting.\bigskip

    \item \structure{manaba Forums}: This is the preferred way for asynchronous communication, since all students can see the question. Other students are highly encouraged to answer or add their opinions.\bigskip

    \item \structure{e-mail}: If you need to ask a private question.
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  One goal of this course is to shed light on the "Dark Curriculum". Please feel free to ask any questions at all about life as a scientist / academic / etc.

  Two "mini-papers". The student must plan, perform, and analyze an experiment of their own choice:\bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a scientific question to answer
    \item Design an Experiment to gather data to answer that question
    \item Execute the experiment, following the design
    \item Analyze the data, following the design
    \item Make a conclusion, based on the analysis of the data
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Grading}{Reports -- More Details}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \structure{Report 1}: Choose a good experiment for a scientific question, and presenting the data (lectures 1 and 2). \bigskip
    \item \structure{Report 2}: Choose a proper hypothesis pre-data collection, and perform the appropriate inferential statistical test (lectures 1-7).
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Students must present their reports on lecture 10.
    \end{itemize}\bigskip
    \item \structure{Topic}: The experiment can be on any topic, but using the same topic as your research theme is recommended.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If your research includes private data, consult with your advisor first.
    \end{itemize}\bigskip

    \item \structure{Important}: Your experiment will {\bf not} be judged based on the "success" of the experiment. Report your results honestly.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Grading}{Reports -- Final Details}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Report must be in English.\bigskip
    \item Report text must be in pdf format.\bigskip
    \item In addition to the PDF, you must also submit all the information necessary to reproduce your experimental results.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item This depends on the experiment, but tipically include data files obtained from the experiment, and scripts used to process this data, generate figures and statistical tests.
      \item Data from the reports will be used only to evaluate the report, and deleted at the end of the course.
    \end{itemize}\bigskip
    \item Deadline for the reports will be posted on manaba.
