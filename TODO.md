# Current
- Redo videos of lecture 1 and 2 to become shorter
- Lecture 2: Add other point estimators: correlation, variance?
- Lecture 3: Fix typos, add code examples

# Talk about Scientists:
- Marie Curie: Lesson 1 (many things you can do as a scientist)
- Charles Darwin: Lesson 2 (data collection and publication)
- Florence Nightingale: Lesson 3 (data visualization)

- A current scientist?

# The hidden Curriculum
- Scientific Community -- Talking to Scientists outside of the lab
- Taking control of your image -- webpage, volunteering, etc
- Research Ethics
- Publishing Venues
- Other ideas?

# Lectures
- Topic 6: Review and Case Study I
  - Add material about review, case study, code study
- Topic 7: Power Analysis, Sample Size and Choosing Samples

## Future
- Topic 9: Blocking and selection of parameters for experiments;
- Topic 10: Case Study II

# Reports
- Report 1: Simple experiment with basic statistical analysis
- Report 2: Simple experiment with Simple Inference analysis
- Report 3: Comparative experiment with multiple population analysis

# Key Ideas
- Reproducible science and its importance
  - Data organization
  - Science communication
  - Open source

- Reading a research paper
  - Order of reading, how to bulk read papers
  - Critically reading papers

- Writing papers and reports
  - Writing for reproducibility
  - Writing for clarity

- Scientific Experiments
  - Noise and uncertainties
  - Hacking and Science
  - Bad science: cargo-cult science, 5% science

- You need to love your scientific topic
  - Reading a lot
  - Keeping up with the literature (arxiv, knowing the researchers)
  - Being excited about the theme
  - Do not limit yourself to your own study

- Limitations
  - Our experiments show an indication of X and Y
  - But we did not examine the influence of Z, so maybe Z has an effect that we did not consider
  - "Future works" is not a place for advertising your work

# Materials

## Future:
- Maybe actually switch lectures 7 and 8
- Greatly improve sample size lecture;
- Lecture 9
- "invisible curriculum of graduate school"
