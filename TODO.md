# General TODO
- Import Manaba files from previous year -- 2022, OK
  - Update General Manaba files -- 2022, OK

- Update Files in LectureNotes
  - Decide when to Submit the Reports -- 2022, OK
  - README
  - Schedule
  - Manaba files
  - Course_Outline.org

- Fix the Lecture Code.

# Per Lecture TODO

- Write the "COMMENTS.md" file, and record the "comments" video.
  - Add new ideas to the TODO of the previous lecture.

- Read and Update the LOCAL TODO:
  - Note the TODO from last year
  - Re-read the material to add new TODOs

- Improve the material following the TODO

- Record new videos

- Add/Remove new ideas to the TODO of the lecture

# Specific for 2022:
Separate the lectures notes in "Topics (material)" and "Reviews" -- Review slides

## New "Topic 05" -- Simple Experiment design
- In Lecture the lectures so far, we assumed always one independent variable, and one dependent variable (and possibly some blocking factors). What if we have more than one variable?
- What is a Factor? (Parameter, Treatment, Control)
- What is an Effect?
- Simple Experiment Design
  - One Variable at a Time (Cannot detect 2nd order effects, can use the methods we studied so far)
  - Factorial Design (Excessive number of experiments)
  - Randomized Design (Unequal pairings)
  - Latin Hypercube Design (Improving the distribution of pairings)
- Consideration: Number of replications (think more about this next class)
- How can we report in this data? (Will talk about it next class)

## New "Topic 08"
- Multiple Dataset testing in CS

  Prepare a lecture based on a close reading of Demsar's paper, focusing
  on hypothesis testing for algorithm comparison in computer science.
  (Maybe replace the Paper Reading Lecture)

  https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/demsar06a/demsar06a.pdf

  A lot of focus on this paper about thinking of the nature of the
  problem and the assumptions of the Statistical testing.
