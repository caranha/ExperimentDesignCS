\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  In this lecture, we deal with two special cases of Statistical Inference:\bigskip
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Equality Testing}: In the last two class, we learned that failing to reject a null hypothesis does not imply that the null hypothesis is true. So how should we perform the analysis when we want to show that two quantities are equal?\bigskip

    \item {\bf Non-normal Data}: The statistics that we discussed until now make the assumption that the sampling distribution is normal. What can we do when this assumption is breached?
  \end{itemize}\bigskip
