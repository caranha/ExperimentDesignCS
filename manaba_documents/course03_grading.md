The grade of this course is based on two reports, and a final examination.

Each report, as well as the final examination, will be graded on a 0-100 scale. The final numeric grade will be calculated as a weighted average, with weights:

- Report 1: 20
- Report 2: 40
- Final Exam: 40

The Letter grade will be based on the final grade using the Tsukuba Standard:

- 0 - 59: D
- 60- 69: C
- 70- 79: B
- 80- 89: A
- 90-100: A+

# Final examination

The final examination will cover the topics of the entire course.

You are allowed to prepare one A4 page of handwritten notes, and bring it to the exam. No other materials can be consulted during the exam. The notes can be in any language, and must be turned in with the exam. The notes will not be graded.

Whether the final examination will be online or in person will be determined by the beginning of June.

# Reports
The students must submit two reports, each of them a "mini-paper". In each report, the student must:

- Choose a scientific question to answer
- Design an Experiment to gather data to answer that question
- Execute the experiment, following the design
- Analyze the data, following the design
- Make a conclusion, based on the analysis of the data

The report, then, should summarize the design, the experiment, the data analysis and the conclusion. The report should be guided by the ideas introduced in the course, specially regarding the data collection (experiment) and analysis.

In the first report, using statistical inference is not required or expected. The report will be graded by the understanding of what is a scientific question, how to design a data collection protocol coherent with the scientific question, and the discussion of the data (lectures 1 and 2).

In the second report, the student will be expect to analyze the data collected through the establishment of statistical hypothesis prior to the experiment, and the calculation of statistical inference metrics after the experiment. (lectures 3-7, optionally 9). The student will be required to present their results on lecture 10.

Note that the reports will NEVER be graded based on the "success" or "failure" of the experiment. The goal of these reports is to practice the honest analysis and discussion of experimental results. Also, the students are encouraged to write reports based on scientific questions inspired by their own research topic, but this is not required.

Other Details:
- The report must be submitted in English.
- The report will be graded on the research question, the experiment design, the data analysis, the discussion, and the reproducibility of the experiment.
- The report must be in PDF format.
- In addition to the report PDF, you must include as separate information necessary for reproducing the experiments and the analysis. This usually means the data files obtained during the experiment, and the code to generate any figures or tables. This data will be used solely for evaluating the report, and will be deleted at the end of the course, after the final grades are registered.
