The grade of this course is based on two reports, and a final examination.

Each report, as well as the final examination, will be graded on a 0-100 scale. The final numeric grade will be calculated as a weighted average, with weights:

- Report 1: 20
- Report 2: 40
- Final Exam: 40

The Letter grade will be based on the final grade using the Tsukuba Standard:

- 0 - 59: D
- 60- 69: C
- 70- 79: B
- 80- 89: A
- 90-100: A+

# Final examination

The final examination will cover the topics of the entire course.

You are allowed to prepare one A4 page of handwritten notes, and bring it to the exam. No other materials can be consulted during the exam. The notes can be in any language, and must be turned in with the exam. The notes will not be graded.

The examination will be Online Synchronous (i.e., it will be held at the time of the Office hours), using the manaba "Tests" system. If this is too difficult for you to attend because of time zones, please contact the instructor.

# Reports

The students must submit two reports during the course. These reports consist of a "mini-paper" about an experiment that the student will prepare, execute and analyze. In each of the two reports the student must:

- Choose a question to investigate using a scientific experiment.
- Design the experiment (choose dependent and independent variables, data collection protocol, and data analysis protocol) to investigate the chosen question.
- Execute the experiment following the data collection protocol.
- Analyze the data obtained, following the data analysis protocol.
- Take note of any surprising or unsurprising findings, and prepare a conclusion for the experiment.

The report must summarize the above points (the question, experiment designs, data collection, data analysis, and conclusion). These points must be guided by the ideas introduced in this course, specially regarding data collection and analysis.

The difference between the first and second report are as follows:

## First Report

In the first report, the student is expected to select an experiment with a single dependent variable and a single independent variable, and calculate the appropriate statistical intervals for the values observed for the dependent variable. These topics are covered in lectures 1 and 2. The student will be graded in their ability of describing a coherent scientific experiment to answer a question, the ability to analyze the experimental data as described above, and the ability to present the results of these analysis in a compelling manner.

*In particular, note that the student is NOT expected to use the null-hypothesis model in this report (lectures 4-6). Doing a hypothesis test will not increase your score, and may actually reduced the score if the test is executed incorrectly. Please proceed with caution.*

## Second Report

In the second report, the student will be expect to analyze the data collected through the establishment of statistical hypothesis prior to the experiment, and the calculation of statistical inference metrics after the experiment (topics covered in lectures 3-8). In addition, the student should analyze whether the data follows the assumptions established by the chosen statistical test, and the number of samples required by the statistical model chosen. The sample size calculation may require the student to do reading beyond the materials presented in class.

As in the first report, the student will be graded in their ability to describe a coherent scientific experiment to answer a question, as well as the ability to create a proper statistical model for that experiment, their ability to do a proper post-hoc analysis of the obtained data, and their ability to summarize and explain the results of this analysis.

## Other Details:

- The report must be submitted in English. It must be submitted as a PDF file.
- In addition to the PDF report, you must also submit a ZIP file with all the data necessary to reproduce your report. Namely, data files, scripts for generating figures, scripts for performing statistical analysis, and code when appropriate. This is necessary to evaluate the reproducibility of the experiment.
- You are encouraged to choose an experiment that is interesting for you for some reason -- a daily life topic that you are honestly curious about, or a topic related to your Master degree research.
- The report will be graded on the research question, the experiment design, the data analysis, the discussion, and the reproducibility of the experiment.
- Note that the report will NOT be graded based on the "success" or "failure" of the experiment. The goal of these reports is to practice the honest analysis and discussion of experimental results.
