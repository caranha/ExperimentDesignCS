# Course goals:
This course aims to educate the student about the basics of the scientific
method, and in particular on how to conduct good scientific experiments, and
analyze their data using statistical techniques. The contents of this course
will focus on Computer Science experiments, although the topics can be applied
to other disciplines as well.

# Teaching format:
Each week, the lecture notes will be published to manaba, and video lectures
will be published to TEAMS. The students are expected to follow the video
lectures and the lecture notes in full, at the time of their preference.
(On demand online lecture)

Additionally, the instructor will hold "office hours" during the regular
lecture times. These office hours will be held online, on TEAMS, and the
students can ask questions about the material, or guidance about the report.

Also, every week a quiz will be posted on manaba, about the material of
that week's lecture. Answering this quiz will count as the attendance check.
The student must answer the quiz, although it will not be graded.

One exception about the "on demand" format is the last class (06/18) when
every student must present their report, and the final exam (06/25),
which will be either in person, or synchronous, depending on the status
of the covid-19 situation. This will be determined at the beginning of June.

# Course policies:
- **Language policy**: The course will be held in English, and the materials
are distributed in English as well. The instructor will accept questions in
Japanese by e-mail, but the reports and final exam must be submitted in English.

- **Plagiarism policy**: No form of plagiarism in the reports or final examination
will be accepted. Plagiarism can be cause for failing the entire course. Reports
