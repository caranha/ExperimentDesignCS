# Recommended Reading

The following resources are recommended readings for the course, related to the class topics, science, academia, or other things I think you could enjoy.

## Class topics
These materials may help you gain a deeper understanding, or a different point of view, on the topics about analysis of experiment presented in class.

### General:
- ["Crash Course Statistics"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr) Youtube playlist: Contains many topics that are discussed in this course, described in a light and educational way.
- [Design and Analysis of Experiments](https://https//github.com/fcampelo/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments). These lecture notes by Felipe Campelo are one of the original inspirations for this course. They discuss in more depth some of the topics discussed in this course.

### Lecture 1: What is experimentalism?
- [Understanding Science](https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/intro_01): This website holds a much more detailed discussion about what is science, science as an interactive process, and the relationship between scientific questions, scientific experiments and the scientific community. Highly recommended reading.

- "Crash Course Sociology" Youtube playlist:
The entire playlist, although interesting, is outside of the course scope. Two of the videos discuss how the ideas of experimentalism and the scientific method apply to the field of sociology. What is similar, and what is different between Social Science experiments and Computer Science Experiments?
  - [Sociology and the Scientific Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIwyNIdgJBE&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtMJ-AfB_7J1538YKWkZAnGA&t=0s)
  - [Sociology Research Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwhK-iEyXYA&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtMJ-AfB_7J1538YKWkZAnGA&t=0s)


### Lecture 2: Point and Interval Indicators
- D.W. Stockburger, [The Sampling Distribution](http://psychstat3.missouristate.edu/Documents/IntroBook3/sbk17.htm). In: Introductory Statistics: Concepts, Models, and Applications. A more detailed look at the concept of “sampling distribution” from lecture 02.
- J.G. Ramírez, [Statistical Intervals: Confidence, Prediction, Enclosure](https://git.io/v5ZFh). This text extends the concept of "Confidence Interval", talking also about other kinds of interval indicators.

## Others:
### R Programming Language

- [R for beginners](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf). An introduction to the R programming language, and its main characteristics.
- [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). A graphical interface for R, very useful for writing, reading and executing R code.
- [ggplot2 library](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). ggplot2 is a very powerful R library for creating beautiful plots from data. Much better than the native plotting functions in R.
