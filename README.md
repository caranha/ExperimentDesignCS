# About this Course

The collection and analysis of data through experiments is one of the cornerstones of the scientific method.

This course aims to educate students about how to conduct good scientific experiments, and how to use statistical tools to analyze data obtained from these experiments.

The contents of this course focus on Computer Science experiments, although the topics can be applied to other disciplines as well.

You can see more information in the full [syllabus](syllabus.md) of the course.
