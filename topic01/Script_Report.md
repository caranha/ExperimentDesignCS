Hello everyone, my name is Klaus
and this is experiment designs for
computer science 2021 Week one Part 5.
So in this last videos we talked about
what is science and what is experimentalism
to summarize the lecture experiment.
What we talked today is that
experiment is a key part of science.
Experiments acquire data that can be used
to validate and falsify scientific ideas.
Can't you answer scientific questions and.
The main idea is that experiments
have to be performed carefully.
We have to perform an experimental design
that will define what kind of experiment
we will do and how the data is gathered OK.
No, there is some recommended reading,
so I talked a little bit before but there
is this website called Under Static Science
hosted by the University of Berkeley.
And it has a very good details about much,
much, much more detail about the
conversation that we had today,
so I highly recommend that you read this, OK?
Also there is this video crash
course sociology.
It's a little bit old,
but it's interesting because it
talks about the site.
If the expert methodology
that we talked about,
but on the field of sociology and it's
interesting to know that even those astrology
is very different from computer science,
the experimental methodology
is similar in many points,
so I think that's an interesting
comparison to do.
Finally, if you want to have some
little bit of a laugh and relax time
thinking about philosophy of science,
existential comics.
Is a comics that I actually read a lot.
It's about philosophy.
I recommend it.
It's good for a laugh.
Alright, but let's talk about the
report so you all have our report,
report one and the idea of report one
is to design and execute ascentive
experiment and report your results.
For this report you need to
choose an experiment, OK?
You will choose the experiment you
think about the experiment design.
You will perform the experiment and
then you will report the results.
The report should consist of an
introduction where you describe your
scientific question, the relevance,
and why do you need to do an experiment
that experiment design as we said,
like what kind of experiment you're doing?
What are the variables
that you are controlling?
Then you need to do the experiment,
so this is expected to actually need to.
Do you do the data collection and
you report what data you collected.
If it was what you expected, it was not.
If there was anything that happened
during the data collection that
changed how you saw your experiment.
OK, and then you do the analysis.
You describe your results in detail and what
answer they provide geoscientific question.
Remember that it's very important to start
practicing how to do reproducible science.
So when you describe the report,
describe it in a way that other people could
reproduce your experiment if they wanted
to try and see and confirm your results.
If you do any.
If you use any programs to do your
experiment, you should include any,
including a separate files in your report.
If you use scripts to analyze your data,
you should include them.
In your report as well.
Oops.
OK, so let's give a little bit more detail.
So how do you choose the experiment?
OK, if possible,
I recommend that you choose
something from your research,
'cause then you can use the work
that you're doing in this lecture
to advance your own research.
It's a win win, right?
But if you cannot do that for any reason,
then experience from your day
to day life are also good.
A lot of people do some good
experiments by doing cooking
techniques or exercises OK?
Also, if you have,
if you really don't have an idea,
comparing algorithms is always a good choice.
It's always. It's always something
with comparing libraries,
comparing programs, comparing systems, etc.
Make sure that you choose an
experiment that you perform OK.
The goal of this experiment is to
practice experimental design and analysis.
You don't need to do a huge experiment
that you take you five years or $10,000.
It can be something very simple.
OK, it can be comparing just a small
program or just as most set of exercises.
It doesn't need to be anything very big.
Usually the best reports that get the best
grades they have like 345 pages at most.
It doesn't, it's I'm not.
Asking for a huge report here
in the next lecture,
we're going to talk a bit about how to
analyze and report the experimental data.
So I think next lecture will be
very useful for this report as well.
Deadlines April 20th.
There is a survey on Manapa asking for
you to describe your experimental report.
This survey will not be graded,
but you need to submit it anyway
because I want to take a look at your
experimental design and make sure that
you're not going too much out of the way.
I have seen some students before,
I just used to ask for the final report
and some students really did not understand
the ideas of experimental design,
so I want to see.
Your design,
just to make sure that you are going the
right way with your design and by May
9 if you have to actually submit your report.
So this is at the end of the Golden Week.
So if you are busy you can do your
experiment during the Golden Week,
but I recommend that you do a little
bit earlier so you have more time to do
the experiment and to analyze the data.
OK and this report will be created.
Alright, these finishes this video.
I hope to see some fun and
interesting reports from you.
And I hope you enjoy the
rest of the lecture.
Have a nice day and take
care of your health. Bye bye.
