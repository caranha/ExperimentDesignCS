Hello everyone, I'm Klaus and this
is experiment designs for computer
science 2021 Week one video,
three in the previous video we talked about
what is science and we mentioned that one
of the key parts of science is experience.
So in this video we're going
to explore a little bit more.
The idea of what is an experiment and
what is a good experiment. So let's go.
So we're going to talk about experimentalism.
First, remember that in the last
video we talked about this dynamic
system of what is science,
right that involved getting the ideas,
testing the ideas,
checking the ideas with your community,
and bringing the ideas for society.
And in the second you see that
the central is experimentation.
Experimentation is how we obtain information.
How we obtain data that's going to let us
answer the scientific questions that we have.
So in this video we're going to
talk a little bit about what and.
Experiment is.
The idea of experiment talking about what a
good experiment is is philosophy of science.
So philosophy of science is the
field of philosophy to discuss how
we obtain knowledge about the world.
So some questions or find a lot of
science is like how can we know things?
Can we learn something you using only logic?
Can we trust our census?
Is knowledge immutable or does
it change overtime?
So this questions is what
philosophers of sizes discuss.
We are interested.
And one philosopher of
science called Core Popper.
So copper.
He proposed the idea of experimentalism.
That is one idea of how to define
scientific knowledge for proper,
the only way to obtain knowledge about
the world scientific knowledge about the
world is using rigorous experimentation.
Rigorous experimentation has three stages.
You formulate a scientific question
as a scientific hypothesis,
then you execute one experiment
that will follow that hypothesis.
And this experiment will either
support or reject your hypothesis.
Now for proper,
it's very important these
definitions of scientific hypothesis.
So he said that the true centive
hypothesis is one that can be falsifiable.
So I falsified the part is is one
that if a happens then maybe my
hypothesis is true, maybe not,
but if B happens then my hypothesis
is definitely false.
Great.
He said that because Popper was very
disagreed with a lot of sites at a time,
for example,
psychoanalysis was at was
considered science at the time
of proper and proper said notes.
Psychoanalysis is not a science
becauses you can only show any anything
that you show confit psychoanalysts.
There's impossible to design an exposure.
Imagine an experiment that the
result of that experiment might
show that psychoanalysis force.
Because of that,
he said the psychoanalysis
was not falsifiable.
So according to Popper, is not a science.
Of course, Freud would disagree with poppers,
so there's this funny idea that
is funny comic about that,
and there's like.
There are different ways
about what makes sense,
but the idea of falsifiable
hypothesis actually very good one
because it limits us to be to
think about hypothesis that can say
something useful about the future.
OK, if the hypothesis falsifiable,
this means that we have
a point to say that hey,
this hypothesis was not correct.
So we can move on and develop new
ways to understand the world.
So this idea of a falsifiable hypothesis
leads to the idea of a fair experiment.
A fair experiment is an experiment
that provides good evidence,
both for if we are correct about
are senstive question or if we are
incorrect it does not confuse us and
a fair experiment will confuse us and
will not give us very good evidence.
Maybe we are wrong,
but because our experiment was not
fair it could not tell us that we are
wrong and that's not the way to look.
At fast signs there are some
people that say the science.
Is there progress towards being less wrong?
OK, so we want our experiments to
show us what we don't know so we
can fix this legs in our knowledge.
So anyway, So what is a fair experiment?
A fair fair experiment has the
following characteristics.
It provides something to compare against.
It controls the variables of interest.
It avoids bias in the results.
It is reproducible and it separates
chess results for real difference.
Now let's explore these points.
So let's start with the first one.
Provide something to compare against,
and here we're really talking
about scientific hypothesis.
OK,
so the scientific hypothesis is
the question that we're trying
to answer with one experiment for
an experience to be useful,
it is necessary that at least
it has two possible results.
This hypothesis is supported,
or the hypothesis is rejected.
It could we have more?
We can be completely surprised.
But anyway,
if we already know the result of
the experiment before doing it,
then why,
if they only possible result of the
experiment is that we were right all along,
then you don't need to do that.
Experiment right?
So that's the idea of a
falsifiable hypothesis.
So let's think about some examples.
First,
this we can use a hypothesis that
compare two different systems,
for example,
chocolate cookies taste better
than meat cookies.
That's my hypothesis.
Now I need to design an experiment
that will show that chocolate cookies.
Taste better than mint cookies?
It's actually not a very good one,
but let's leave it for now.
We can use a hypothesis to compare
explanations to a phenomenal.
So bananas turn black in the
refrigerator cause of bacteria,
not because of the temperature
of the refrigerator.
So we can think of an experiment
that would save it.
Tell me that if it's true or false,
for example,
if we put true bananas and they are
in completely sterile environments
with no bacteria or hypothesis,
says that even if we put a
stereo banana in a fridge,
it will not turn black.
So we can test that OK.
We can also use a hypothesis to test
the characteristic of a system.
For example, we can say that one
Apple tree is enough to feed
our home for the entire year,
so this is a hypothesis that says OK,
how much apples that reproduces,
and how much we eat,
and we can test that by trying to
do an experiment and seeing how much
the tree will produce and comparing
that to vote against how much we eat.
OK. There's something else to be
said about scientific hypothesis.
OK, one characteristic of a good set of
hypothesis is that they are specific.
OK, the more detail that you give to the
question that you're trying to answer,
the easier this through design.
At good experiment that will either
support or refuse or hypothesis
first as we have here.
4 levels of hypothesis about
the same question.
The first one is like my
optimization method is the best.
How do you do and experience what does
it mean to be the best is best compared
to what is the best in the world?
It's the best in Japan.
This is the best thing scuba so we can
improve a little bit for saying the
optimization method that proposed in
this paper is better than methods that
already exist in the previous one.
It was so general that when
I say it's the best,
I'm saying it's the best now and
the best that will always exist.
But now I'm limiting.
I'm saying that the method then it's
this one that I'm proposing this
paper it's not any other method.
It's better than the ones that already exist,
but we can make it more specific.
For example,
I could say using polynomial would
tation is better than Gaussian
mutation for optimization methods.
When I say existing methods
what does this mean?
Does it means like everything
every single method?
How do I test every single method that exist?
So here I'm being more specific,
I'm saying there is this method
that is polynomial mutation and
it's better than Gaussian mutation.
OK. But here's a question.
This this word better.
What does it mean to be better?
OK, there are many different ways.
Is it matter because it's
easier to understand?
Is it better because it's faster?
Is it better because it
doesn't ever have bugs,
so we want to specify that as well.
Polynomial mutation increases the
convergence rate of an optimization method
when compared to Gaussian mutation.
So now it's really easy to do
an experiment because we're
saying what we have to measure,
we have to measure the convergence rate.
And we're seeing what we have to compare.
We have to compare polynomial
mutation with Gaussian mutation.
Now of course we could make
it even more specific,
but I think you get the idea.
The more specific your hypothesis is,
the easier it is to test.
And I see many times in some
reports he rolled.
Method A is best or method
B is more efficient.
Make it more specific best
compared to what more specific,
more efficient in which sense?
So in computer science,
the more specific you can
make your hypothesis,
the easier it is to test.
Another important characteristic
for good scientific report is,
like I said before,
is that they are falsifiable.
A falsifiable hypothesis is one that
could be proven false. As we said,
let's think about this in computer science.
Can have a hypothesis, says this
neural network can solve any problem.
If we find the right parameters.
This hypothesis is not falsifiable.
Why's it not?
Let's say that we get a problem.
We try to solve it in your
network and the neural network
does not solve the problem well.
Based on this hypothesis,
we could say well,
it didn't solve the part of the problem,
but that's because it did not
have the right parameters.
So we change the parameters and it
doesn't solve it, Richard changed.
Meters and doesn't solve in this hypothesis.
We can never say that this
hypothesis is false.
'cause maybe there is one set
of parameters that solve the
problem that we didn't find yet.
So this hypothesis is not falsifiable,
and it's not very useful.
Although the hand.
A way to do a similar hypothesis,
but make it falsifiable.
We can say using algorithm A and
this algorithm could be a neural
network and parameters Theta and
this parameters could be one set
of parameters or could even be
another algorithm that chooses
the parameters for you.
So if we use a neural network using
this method to choose the parameters,
then we grow and achieve a speed up of 1.5.
And here I'm being very specific about
what it means to solve the problem.
We achieve a speedup of 1.5.
Own benchmark B.
Now everything is a specific
I can do this experiment.
I can get algorithm a parameters to
calculate the speed up on benchmark B,
and maybe I don't get it and
my hypothesis will be shown
false by the experiment,
which is great because it shows that
I have I trust my hypothesis so much
that I can propose an experiment
that would say it would be false.
But I'm pretty sure that we will
not be because I trusted and if it
is then I learned something new.
OK,
so that's the idea of a
falsifiable hypothesis.
OK, let's go to point to point.
Choose says that a fair experiment
controls the variables of interest.
We have it right here.
OK, so. What does it mean?
There are many variables that affect
the results of an experiment.
For example,
if we want to test if chocolate ice
cream tastes better than coffee,
the result of your experiment will
be different if you ask children,
or if you ask PhD students,
because of course all PT students
love coffee, right right anyway?
So if you're scientific,
question is focused on the
opinion of PhD students,
then you can control the
variables of the experiment.
And not include's children or
professors in your service,
so you're interested to know
their opinions of PhD students.
You don't call children you.
You don't include professors and that
you are now controlling your experiment.
OK,
now depending on how much freedom you have,
you not always have freedom
to control the experience.
Depend on the kind of
experience that you have.
You can have more or less freedom to
control the variables of the experiment,
so we can classify experimenting three
types of observational experiments.
Retrospective experiments
and controlled experiments.
So let's talk about all of them.
Observational experiments and
observation Experiment is an object
experiment where you obtain the data
by observing a phenomenon without
interacting with it directly,
and this is the majority of,
for example, astronomy experiments.
You cannot change the stars,
so you point your telescope it and
you observe the star and you get data.
OK, more more.
Local example is you count the
number of people who use the
train with and without masks.
So you want to know if.
When the government says we
are in an emergency state,
if more people use this mask, so use it.
So you put someone to sit in
front of the school bus station.
They get like a paper and every
time someone goes around a mark
or this person has a mask,
this person does not have a mask.
This person has a mask,
so that's an observational experiment.
OK, now there are some.
Issues about observational experience.
First,
eight require care to observe
representative situation.
If we think about the way
that we talk about scuba.
If you send the person to the
station at 10 in the evening,
you will only see very few
people because there are very few
people in the train at that time.
If you see if you send them
at 6:00 in the afternoon.
They will see a lot of people in the train.
So what is representative?
What is a representative sample of the
people that you are interested for?
Your experiment?
That's a variable that you have to control.
These experiment also allows you
to choose the general conditions,
so you can say I'm only interested
in the movements of the station
during the week days.
I'm not interested in the weekends.
OK,
in some cases the situation
of interest may be
too rare to observe naturally,
so you are interested in knowing how
many people break their legs when they
go down the stairs of the station.
Well, maybe only one person
per year breaks the legs or I
don't really know the number,
but it's very rare.
So if you just send someone to sit at
the station and look you want to know
the conditions that people break their legs,
maybe they can sit there for one
month and they will not see anyone
breaking the leg at this station.
So it might be hard to observe with
the observational experiment.
OK, a second type of experiment
is the retrospective experiment,
so a retrospective experiment is
one that the research obtains the
data from historical deck records.
So basically the experiment the
researcher looks at, maybe newspapers,
or at past data or registers or other
scientific papers there is a kind of
research that is very common in medicine
that you get the results of many papers,
that is study the same disease.
Or the same medicine and you put all the
results together and you compare them OK?
For example,
you can search from the relationship
between the announcements of celebrity
marriages and the total number of marriages.
So you look at the newspaper and see when
the celebrity announced their marriage,
and then you go to the city office
and you see if the number of marriages
increased in comparison with the
average number of merits per day.
So that would be a retrospective experiment.
There is one that is very interesting that
a bunch of that I saw recently on Twitter.
Some people were plotting data of.
When the Sakura first appeared
in Kyoto in different years,
so in cultivated get OK,
Sakurai started blooming on this
day like for the 2nd of March or
the 30th March or the 15th of March,
and by looking at these registers you
can see the changes in temperature
cause the changes in when the Flowers
bloom tracks with the changes in
the temperature in the year.
So we can use that as evidence to
show if the temperature has been
changing or not in Japan.
OK,
So what are the characteristics
of retrospective experience?
Well,
first they are usually cheaper and
that may be the only way that you can
get data about for a long period of time.
You cannot get data from like thousands,
hundreds of years of soccer does blooms
without going to retrospective experiment.
Of course, one problem with that is
that if you're looking at the records,
maybe the record is not available
for certain parts of the year,
so maybe they did not take records
during the World Wars.
Or,
depending on what you're doing,
there might be a bias in the record.
For example,
if people are recording the opinions
of the votes or the intentions of votes,
maybe they don't record the opinions
of women when women could not
vote and things like that.
So the record may be partial.
OK,
so that's a problem with
retrospective experiments.
Another is that of course you
cannot control exactly when you are
observing or what you are observing.
You only have available.
You only have access to the
information that is available.
The third type of experiment
is the controlled experiment.
OK, in a controlled experiment,
the researcher is able to define the
variables, so this is the experiment.
It is usually more common
in computer science,
although we do have retrospective
experiment and observational
experience in computer science.
But it is one we control everything.
So for instance,
we develop a new algorithm and we test
on a benchmark on different computers.
So we control which computers we test on.
We control which algorithms we use.
We control how many times
we repeat the experiment.
We control what are the computer types
that is run so we can control everything.
So this gives you a lot of control.
Of course you can do ** print
exactly the way they want.
On the other hand.
With great control comes
great responsibility.
If you don't choose which
variables carefully,
you may insert P as in the
experiment and we're going to talk
about this a little bit later.
This can usually be very expensive
for biology or for medicine.
For computer science,
not always because running experiments in
computer is usually not very expensive,
but it can be OK.
All right, the Third Point,
and that's what we're talking about.
A fair experiment controls for biases,
so when you control the
variables of your experiment,
or even when you don't,
you can introduce bias test result.
For example, let's say that we compare
the speed of two computer programs.
It may be hard to see the difference if.
To run their computer programs in computer.
Very powerful, although the hand if you run
their two programs in a very slow computer,
the differences may be exaggerated.
So which one is correct?
OK, it depends on your scientific question.
To have a fair experiment,
you need to be aware of these sources
of biases and you have to change
your experiment to avoid this.
Bias is an changing their controlled
variables to avoid biases is one of
the main tasks of experimental design,
which is the title of this course.
So some common experiment design questions.
Which methods do we compare in the
experiment? Which datasets do we use?
How many times do we interview
each participant in a participant?
In what order do we perform the experiment?
The order of the experiment
can influence the results.
Which data do we report etc etc.
There are many questions.
Everything that you could
control in your experiment.
You have to think about why
you are controlling it or why
you're not controlling it.
Let's give you a concrete example.
Let's say that we are comparing 2 computer
programs to measure their running times
and that will be just a wall Clock time.
We're going to start the program,
look at the Clock and the program,
look at the Clock and say this
program took 10 seconds to run.
So we know that when we run a program,
the running time is affected by
other programs in the system versus
if I start to run a program and
then I open a video on YouTube.
Then the program will then
give them a computer.
You use more memory for the
browser and my computer.
My my program may become
slower because of that,
or if I run into complete the
program and the computer decides
to do a defragmentation that
will make the computer slower.
OK, so over if the software updates, right?
So to control this variation,
what can we do?
Well,
one thing that we can do is that we
can run the experiment on a system
with a minimum number of programs.
To avoid this.
Another thing that we can do is that
we can run this program like many times
and takes the average running time
because maybe the second time that
the program ran there was an updated.
It was slow, but because we're
running 10 times on average,
this slowness will not have
a very big impact. OK.
Here's another example.
Here is using humans.
Imagine that you were doing an
experiment that you compare two websites,
so you have one that uses images and
one that does not use this images
and the idea is that you want to see
which of their websites they called
the UR user finds information faster.
So you ask the user to find
information on website a.
Then you ask the user to find
information on website B.
Now if you always do this comparison
in the same order first aid,
then be first aid and be.
What happens it may happen that
the user is faster on website B,
not because website be is easier
to understand,
but because the user already knows
what information they are looking for,
so they kind of already prepared.
We say that they are already primed OK,
so to avoid this priming effect,
what you can do is that when you
ask the user to find information,
it's random if they use,
they will see first website.
First first website be,
maybe half of the users will see
website a first and half of the
users will see website be first.
So that's one way that we can design
our experiment to reduce the bias.
Final example, let's say that we propose a
neural network for a new vision problem,
and we can compare it with
the traditional architectures.
Now, because you're generating a new network,
you do this many times before the experiment,
you test it on a small training data set and
you change the size of your architecture.
You change it under the number of weights
you change many parameters until you get
the best result on the training data set,
and then you do the experiment.
With the other algorithms, but hey,
you're only using all the training data set,
not on the test set, so it's fair, right?
Well, actually,
it's not very fair 'cause you spent a long
time fine tuning the parameters of your
neural network while the other neural
networks that you took from the literature,
you just do their parameters.
Maybe your experiment,
maybe your data is very different
and it would be good to find tune
the other methods to this new data
training data as well to make sure that.
All of them receive the same effort
in fine tuning that,
so each control ferness across
different algorithms.
Another way to control for bias
is to preregister experiments.
Now this is something that is not
very common in computer science,
but it's more common in psychology.
What does it mean to pre
register the idea for a register?
Is that before you do the experiment,
you say exactly what experiment
we're going to do and you published.
So you put your publication
becomes two parts, 1st to publish.
I'm going to do this.
And then you do the experiment
and you publish the result.
This helps you to avoid changing
the experiment in the middle if
you find some different results
from not expected like you start
your own experiment and you see
that your method is going very
bad and you have an idea.
Of course it's going bad.
I forgot to change this and you change
that and now you introduce bias to
your experience because you change
your experiment after it began.
Prodigious tration of helps you avoid that.
OK, the first point that we said is
that good experiments are reproducible.
So reproducibility is an important
quality of a good experiment.
Why's that? Because when you
have a reproducible experiment,
other people can confirm your results
so they can check that you really write
and you write in different conditions.
They can also build on your results,
they can improve the name.
Remember that we talked about how
Mary created helped the development
of other research by making her.
Techniques open the same thing happens
when you do a reproducible experiment.
They can improve your results and
society can use your results easier.
I mean, many times I've tried to use
the research that was published by
other authors just to find out that
they did not describe their algorithms
completely and I could not reproduce
the experiments because the description
of the algorithm was not complete.
So that's something that we
have to be careful about.
So how can we make experiments
more reproducible first?
Is to do a clear experiment design.
It's a little bit related to registration if
you describe your experiment very carefully,
it becomes easier for other
people to reproduce it.
What are the values of the parameters hold?
The results are processed and evaluated.
We can also use open data and open
source if the date of experiment is open.
It's easy for other people to
reproduce it if the code is open.
It's easy for other people to run
it on their software.
OK,
I personally believe that
for computer science,
open source of longer or
in research is essential.
A large majority of the
research is publicly funded,
so we have a duty to return what
we learn that you that should be
public that fund our research
flew open source software OK.
Also open documentation.
Open documentation is related
to open source software.
It's making open day programs that you
use to generate tables to generate figures,
so using this people can see what
kind of treatment you did on
your data and how you can.
How can change it if they want to see
your data from a different point of view.
Alright, the last point is
separate chance for reality.
What does this mean?
Experiments in the real world almost
never give exactly the same result.
If you try, for instance,
if if you maybe during high school you
did an experiment where you throw a
ball and you measure gravity and you
might have notice that when you throw
a ball and you measure it for Clock.
Even though graft is always the same,
there is a slightly different results
because of air resistance orbu 'cause
you have to click on the Clock and it's
not exactly precise and many other reasons.
This is called noise.
These are sources of noise
and sources of noise.
They can hide the truth of a
cyantific question. They can make it.
Oh is this result real or is
this just a coincidence?
OK, now. The methods to avoid.
Mixed in coincidence and real results,
there is a lot of literature in
the sighting in the statistics to
help that there are many techniques
in statistics to help us remove
noise for an experiment.
So of course good experiment
design also helps remove noise,
but good analysis is also essential and
a lot of this course we're going to
spend talking about these techniques
is starting from the next lecture,
so I'm not going to talk about that today.
Alright, so to summarize,
many scientific discoveries
and scientific advancements,
as well as your master thesis
depends on good experiments aid,
but it's not as just run their program,
get the data and experience is
a little bit more than that.
The most important thing that I want
to understand from this class is
that careful planning is necessary
before you do an experiment,
you need to plan it,
and this is called experimental design.
Cape.
Thank you and in the last video we're
going to talk a little bit about
other topics like the report so.
