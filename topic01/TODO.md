# TODO -- Lecture 1 Experimentation

Ideas to improve this lecture in 2023

- Include a better discussion about Computer Science as a Science.
  - Talk about hacking, developing, and experimenting with computer science.
  - Might be a different lecture, too much content.
  - Or maybe move something from this lecture to another one.

- Improve the part discussing the CBR, I'm not "feeling" it.
  - Review the facts about when the Inflation theory was stablished,
  - Review the facts about how CBR provided evidence for Inflation.

- Change CITRUS slide so it does not use a single huge image.

- The video 3 (About "good experiments") is too rambly
  - Think about the focus of this lecture, and make reduce it accordingly.
  - Focus more sharply about how to use experiments on day to day life
  - What is the first thought to make an experiment -- In fact, everyone already
    knows and do this.
    - First, you need to convince yourself, then you need to convince the world.
  - Think about the XKCD comig about zits and face cream.
