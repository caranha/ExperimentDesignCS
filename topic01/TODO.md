# TODO -- Lecture 1 Experimentation

# TODO 2023

- Include a better discussion about Computer Science as a Science. Maybe in a separate lecture. What about computer science?

- Improve the explanation of CBR to include a discussion about the falsifiability
of theories.

- The description of "fair" experiment is kinda all over the place.

- change CITRUS slide so it does not use a single huge image.

## Lecture 1 is too rambly.
- Think about the focus of this lecture, and maybe break it down accordingly.
