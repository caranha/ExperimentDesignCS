Hello everyone, I'm Klaus and welcome to
experiment designing computer science 2021.
In the last video I was
talking about bodies science.
And they talked about the
history story of Mary Queen.
In this video I'm going to continue
talking about what is science
and we're going to start by
talking about 2 interesting and
different scientific discoveries,
the cosmic background radiation and citrus,
fruits, and scurvy.
So let's talk about cosmic
background radiation.
A lot of researchers in physics
are very interested in discovering
how the universe works.
So one question is like,
how did the universe begin?
How did the universe,
how it became what it is today right?
Alot of particle physicists
and other side and astronomers.
They look at the universe and as you know,
as you look far away or in the
universe as you look through far
away stars in faraway galaxies.
You get information from a long
long time ago in our universe,
so they use this information to stab
Lish theories about how the universe began.
One of these into the theories that
is most well supported is called
the inflation theory deflate.
The idea of the inflation theory
is that in the beginning the very
first moments of the universe,
the universe was.
Infinitely dense and infinitely hot.
It was made of hot plasma and at
some point a few seconds a few
milliseconds after the beginning of
the universe at beginning of time,
this hot plasma. Suffered a very quick.
And very intense expansion time.
It's space itself expanded,
reducing the density of the universe,
cooling it down and allowing particles,
atoms, molecules, stars, galaxies to form.
This is called the inflation theory.
OK,
so how do we know that this
inflation theory is well supported?
How?
Why do you think that the inflation
theory is a good description of how the
universe behave in the very first moments?
Well.
There is actually some very good
evidence and experiments that
supports and I want to talk about it.
First,
let's talk about what deflation
theory predicts.
OK,
the idea is that the inflation theory
says that the universe was very
dense and very hot in the beginning,
and then it expanded and became cooler.
So following this theory,
the idea is that at some at the
beginning when the universe was hot plasma.
It was opaque.
Light could not really pass through it,
so you could not.
You could not have like like
lighting passing around,
but as a space expanded the universe
became less dense and colder at some moment.
The universe became sparse enough
that it could each became transparent,
but it was still hot enough
that it glowed so.
However,
a few moments later the universe became
colder and the plasma stopped glowing.
So we have these small transition
time between the universe because
Cohen frontal picture transparent and
the universe going from hot to cold
where we have this glow that happened
at all the place in the universe.
In the same time.
So this is a prediction of
the inflation theory.
If the inflation theory is true then
there would have been this moment.
When did the reformers predicted
with the theory was proposed?
We had this prediction,
but we didn't really know
if that happened or not.
OK. But many years later,
there was a there were there were the micro,
the microwave background
radiation was observed.
Anne and it was interesting because
these radiation followed all
everything that we expected from this
prediction of the inflation theory.
It was a radiation that came from all
of the universe at the same time,
so it was consistent to the idea that
the universe was entirely dense and hot.
OK, The the interesting thing
about the microwave background
radiation is that it does not come
from One Direction or one star.
On their Galaxy it comes from everywhere
at the same time and the properties,
the frequencies of the radiation
matches those that we expected
from this instant of the universe,
cooling down, becoming transparent,
but it's still too hot to shine and then
cooling down and not shining anymore.
So by looking at this evidence that comes
from the microwave background spectrum,
we can say that hey,
we think that these there's there's
something going on with these.
Inflation theory that might really explain
why how the universe behavior the beginning.
So that's very cool.
It was a theory about how the universe
and the theory was initially described.
The cause of the speed of the galaxies
and planets moving away from each other.
So it indicated that the universe
at the beginning everything was
much more closer together,
so that's how they die.
S idea of I stand in the beginning of
the universe when it was very dense.
And the consequence of that was
that they predicted that there
would be something like this flash,
and they identify the flash in this data.
So that's something about how we
can use experiments in science
to understand a little bit more
about the University works.
The other experience which talk
about this very different.
It's a little bit less how they say.
Metaphysical, it's little little
lies about something that happened.
Billions of years in the past and
more about something that happened
much more recently and has a
much more practical application.
So now I want to talk about the 18th century,
the British Empire.
That goes from when the sunsets
to the sound from the sunrise
or sunset sun never sets on the
British Empire ships going around,
colonizing all around and plundering the
treasures of many different countries,
and for the British Empire,
the fleet was one of the most
important things for them,
so there is this Scottish doctor
James Lind that wanted to know
how they could keep the sailors
in the English fleet healthier.
How could they survive longer voyages?
Add spent less time, sick, etc.
So he developed many different techniques
and did many different studies to
improve the health of sailors,
and we're going to talk about one of them,
which is how to prevent scurvy.
Now if you don't know about scurvy,
scurvy is a disease that is very common
among sailors, especially sailors,
from ancient times.
Scurvy is that you can identify scurvy.
It causes a lot of wounds in your mouth.
And it was a very, very important
cause of fatalities among ship crew.
So he wanted to know how to prevent
chorus coffee and today we know that
is scurvy is caused for a deficiency
of vitamin C in the body and.
When you are in the sea,
you don't have vitamin C.
We usually eat vital machine
fruits and they see you don't
have access to fresh fruits.
So that's what causes scurvy.
But they didn't know that.
Then how did James Lind?
And they find that well,
one thing that he noticed is that
different ships had different sometimes
scurvy happen and sometimes it's
curved it and James Lynch saw that OK,
people with scurvy,
they have this source in the mouth and
this source looked like it was rotting.
So he proposed that.
Well, maybe the blood is rotting,
so maybe we can use something to prevent
the blood from rotting the body from rotting.
If we defeat things for the sailors
that prevent them for hunting.
Then they will not have scurvy anymore.
So what he did is that he
could took six ships.
The 612 sailors that were affected
by scurvy separated them and
gave them exactly the same diet,
exactly the same food,
but with one difference.
So for one group, he gives cider.
For our second he gave vitreal
for a third he gave vinegar.
For a fourth he gave seawater.
For five, he gave oranges lemons,
and for the six he gave tea.
Of course he gave TB 'cause it
was they were British sailors.
Anyway,
he notice that two of the groups became.
Better Group One that took cider
that is basically a wine made
of apples and the Group 5 that
took origin levels and both of
these they were citric fruits,
so this experiment taught to James
lent that by eating citric fruits
you could reduce the symptoms of.
Scurvy?
Of course he was wrong about what
exactly was caused scurvy and why the.
Why did his experiment actually worked but?
That's something that is actually
interesting about his science,
even though he was not completely
clear on what was the under.
Mechanisms of scurvy and vitamin C
people didn't know about vitamins
in the time of James Lind,
but by doing any strict,
very coordinated experiment he was able
to find some new information that was useful,
in fact,
by adding orange and lemons and limes to
the diets of sailors in the Royal Navy,
they reduced the incidence
of scurvy by a lot.
So that's why the.
The United Kingdom Navy was
cold as the line is after that.
That's because they had eaten all lines
in the ship that was sure for its curvy.
OK,
so that is something very interesting.
Like how can you use the scientific method?
So in the first experiment we saw,
OK,
we're using experiments to try to
figure out if our tour is about
the beginning of the universe is
true, so we want to know more
about the origins of the universe.
Here we use in a similar
idea we make up we make.
Hypothesis that makes a prediction,
and we use that to find something
of a much more practical nature.
OK, so there are many
different ways to do science.
OK, so from these examples what we
see is that the scientific progress
process has some common characteristics.
OK, maybe you learned this following
description in high school or when you
enter University the scientific method.
So the idea of their cyantific method is 1
observer felimon qui propose a hypothesis,
three perform an experiment
and four draw conclusions.
Is this a good description of
what is science? Well, it's not.
Wrong, but it's incomplete.
It's kind of a straw man of science.
OK, it has some limitations though.
What are the limitations?
Well, this does not explain where this
questions or hypothesis come from.
Where did the hypothesis about
the inflation came from?
Where did the hypothesis about the lime
and vitamin C are discovered come from OK?
Also, what happens if two scientists
they do the same experiment but
they reach different conclusions?
This does not explain to us
that this is very important.
Science disagree about many
things all the time, right?
Also,
these description assumes that
incentive program process ends
after the data collected so,
but even if you learn something new how this
this new knowledge you got benefit society,
right?
Or what do you do after
you finish this experiment?
ETC etc etc.
So we need an explanation that
is a little bit more robust.
OK about what he says.
This image that you're seeing here it's
proposed by the Understanding Science
website that is linked on the extended
readings for these for this week,
and I really recommend you reading that,
and this is a more complete
view of the process of science.
It involves ideas, data,
this Antifa community society,
and it's a continuous feedback cycle.
So let's break it down a little bit.
The first thing that we see in this
cycle is that you have many errors.
OK, you can start from this exploration
and discovery area and then you go
to test your ideas and from testing
your ideas you get community feedback
and you bring it to benefits and to
discovery or in a different area.
You can start with an idea, test it,
talk with the committee tested again,
talk with the community and then get a
different idea to do a different experiment.
OK, so these dynamic process shows that
science happens differently depending
on what your ideas are and how you
interact with society and how you
directive set if community and how your
experiments go OK, it's a living system.
Let's break it down.
OK, so in the top we have this
entry point that is exploration and
discovery and the ideas here is where
the ideas scientific ideas come from.
So we have these entry points
like new technologies like a new
technology might give you an idea.
So we have now very good.
Neural networks to generate
images from existing images.
Someone had this idea recently.
Hey, can I create like an image of genetic
a picture and make that picture move?
I think you might have seen
this on social media recently,
like a technique that may take a
picture and the picture talks.
So this is new ideas came in from new
technology or sometimes curiosity,
right?
So the people.
Let you know hate how many digits of
Pi can I discover with a computer?
How many digits of Pi kena calculate?
And they do in the right?
Huge computers and huge programs to
calculate as many digits of Pi denken.
Or sometimes it can be set in dipity
sensitivity here means coincidence.
You might have heard the story of
how penicillin that is or antibiotics
one of the most important idea
doctors was discovered.
Basically the person who discovers.
Pedestal in they had many bacteria in
their laboratory and they went on a
vacation and we know they went on vacation.
They left the bacteria near the window.
AMOLED came and start killing the bacteria.
When they came back they saw that
all the bacteria that they have
was killed by this mold and they
said they could said oh I have to
clean this instead they started to
study this mold and they found out
that emote was really good to kill
bacteria that attacks our health.
OK so because.
They went on vacation and they didn't
really clean the lab.
They had this chance to do this
very important discoveries
in the world so. There are many
different ways to get scientific ideas.
OK, you make observations about the world
to share ideas with people and other
people can discuss and improve your ideas.
You can ask questions, etc.
After you have your idea then
you have you have to test it OK
and this is about experience.
We're going to talk about
this in the next video,
so I will not stay very long on this one,
but that's they.
Do you have an idea?
And now you have to do an experiment to
get data to see if your idea has merit.
If you are correct in your
idea of your incorrect,
or maybe if something completely
different happens and then you have
this internal loop of gathering the
data because an experiment is really a
way for you to get your data about the road.
And then you interpreted data
and after interpret the data,
maybe you have something surprising,
or you can support your idea and then you
gather more data and you interpret again OK.
Then you have this link
that is very important.
That is the community and the community.
Here is the scientific community
is people that are going to.
You're going to publish your paper
in a conference or in a Journal,
and the reviewers who give you
feedback or and then you get accepted.
Or maybe you are rejected and you
publish your paper to archive and
someone else read your paper and maybe
they have an idea or they give you an idea.
They give you some feedback.
You go to the conference
and you get motivated.
When you talk to people and all of this.
It can come back to give you
new ideas for experiments.
When someone say hey,
how about you try this?
Or when you see someone else experiment
and or you have a discussion like
yesterday I was having a discussion
with another professor and said hey we
should do an experiment about that.
So that goes and go back to the top.
OK?
Or maybe you present your paper
and you put it on the Internet
and the company says hey,
your research is really good.
We were to buy that or they just
do your research and a copy it
and they don't give you any credit
that happens sometimes too.
Not very good.
And then you have the benefits
and outcomes to society.
So at some point your research
will become a benefit to society.
Sometimes it's just because people know more,
and that's really cool.
To know more about the universe.
Or sometimes you can use your
research to change policy.
So hey, we really should use masks to
prevent covid from spreading around.
Or hey,
we should spread out and we should we
notice that covid spreads better in place,
there closed.
So let's stay in open places,
right?
Or you can maybe make a product
create a new kind of computer.
So that's it. Then, after the
benefits from the benefits,
you can say hey, I got this benefit,
but now I have a new question and
that can begin the cycle again.
So just summarize this video.
So what is science? OK?
Well there is not one simple question,
but one simple answer.
But we can say that science is a method,
a way of thinking and also
our community of people.
A process of search and discovery
that continuous changes and
exchange by our society.
Again, I highly recommend that you
read the understanding Science webpage.
It's very easy to read it.
It's written mainly towards high
school students, but I think it's
really useful for us as well.
There is a lot of things that you
think you know, but you don't or you.
Forgot and lots of very good examples.
OK, and you might notice that a
lot of these talks about science
is usually about physics or about
chemistry or about biology.
What about computer science?
And this is something that I want you
to think about in the rest of this course.
I will try to bring the
focus to computer science.
That's what we are interested in,
but maybe you want to put something
on the web about how you think.
That computer science it directs with
ideas of science. What parts apply?
What parts don't apply OK Now?
This is going to end this video,
and in the next video I'm going to focus
on that middle circle experimentation,
so I see you there.
