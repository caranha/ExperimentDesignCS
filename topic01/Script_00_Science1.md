Hello, I'm Claus Aranha at the University of Tsukuba,
and this is Experiment Design for Computer Science.

In this first lecture, I want to talk about the
key concept that we are going to study in this course
"What is an experiment".

To talk about experiments, I think it is useful to begin
by discussing "What is science", and that is the topic
of this video.

So let's get started.

==

So what is Science?

==

Everyone enrolled in this course is part of the
"Master Degree in Computer SCIENCES".

So I'd like to ask you, what do you think that this word, "science" means?
Pause the video now, and think about it for a bit.

(wait a little bit)

Here are some answers from students in past years.

- Science is a method to learn about the world
- or Science is a method to reach the truth,
- or science is a method to improve society
- or science is how we develop new technologies.

I would enjoy it very much if contribute your ideas on manaba, or in the
video comments.

==

Of course, "What is Science" is a very open question, and I would say
that all answers from the students to a degree.

Science is a word that mean different things to different people,
different groups, different societies, and different times in history.
So it is not surprising that students have different answers to this question.

Of course, if we look at the different answers, we still see some common
characteristics.

Two main points that often appear in student answers is that it is about how
to obtain new knowledge and, more specifically, how to obtain a better
understanding of the physical world.

Also, there is common point in the answers that science is not just "obtaining
knowledge", but a specific methodology that you follow to obtain this knowledge.

On the other hand, there are some ideas that are usually NOT included
in the answers from the students. And I think these ideas are very important
to understand what we call science.

One is the role of community for science. The exchange of
ideas is an important part of the scientific process, and this exchange
requires a community, right?

Another is how science is a "continuous" process. It is not something with
a beginning and an end, but something that permeates our way to see the world.

Finally, the relationship between science and society. And this is a two-way
relationship. Science influences society, and society influences science.

==

So we will talk about these points in the next video. But in this video,
I would like to talk about my favorite way to think about science.

Which is, "look at someone who I think is a scientist, and try to understand
what they do". I think this can give us some really good insights.

Also, I think it is very important in our lives to look for people that
inspire us. It is good from time to time to have heroes!

So in this video I would like to talk a little bit about Marie Curie.

==

So who is Marie Curie?

Marie Curie was born in Poland, In 1867, and died in 1934. That is quite young.

She was a physicist and chemist, and a pioneer on the study of radioactivity.
A lot of what we understand about radioactivity comes from Curie's research.

Her achievements are highly celebrated by the Nobel prize. She was the first
woman to win the Nobel, and she is the only woman to win the Nobel two times.

Also, she is the only person, man or woman, to win the Nobel Prize in two
different disciplines: one in physics, and another in chemistry.

I want you to remember that in her time, it was very hard to be recognized as
a woman for your achievements, so the prizes that Curie received are a real
testament for the importance of her research.

==

So, one thing that I really like is to study who scientists were as a person.

Not only their research achievements, but learning a bit about their lives
as well.

So, about Marie Curie. As I mentioned before, she was born in Poland.
One interesting thing is that she wanted to enroll in a local University
to learn chemistry, but she was not allowed, because the local university
did not accept women.

To solve this problem, she enrolled in what was called at the time
a "Flying University", a sort of "Pirate" university that was sponsored
by private individuals to give access to education for people that
would not normally have this access.

So even 2 centuries ago, we can how important it is to have initiatives
to extend access to education and science to communities that normally
do not have this access. Think about that.

Also, to support herself, she had to work as a tutor and a home teacher.
If you are a working as a TA this year, I hope that you can see
a little bit of Marie Curie in yourself as well!

==

Let's talk a little bit about her life as a researcher. She moved to Paris to
earn a physics degree after her study in the "Flying University".

For most of her life as a researcher and as a professor, even after she
started to attract attention to her discoveries, she had difficulty
finding funding for her work.

Her laboratory was basically a shed in the university, and she had
to gather equipment from many different sources, and build a lot of this
equipment by herself. It was hard to find resources to support
students and assistants.

I really recommend that you look for a podcast or book about the
life of Marie Curie. It is really interesting to hear about the challenges
that she faced, and how she overcame them.

==

Moving on to Marie Curie's research.


In her time there was a lot of interest in the nature of radioactive materials.

People knew that radiation existed, but they wanted to understand
why some materials emitted radiation while others didn't, and what were
the mechanisms that regulated the amount of radiation that a material
emitted.

Does it change over time? What conditions influence the radiation of materials?

One of the earliest significant discoveries by Marie Curie was that the
quantity of radiation produced by a material depended only on the amount of
that material.

So she wanted to know how does the quantify of radiation from a material changes.

For example, if I hit a uranium rock with a hammer, adding some force to it,
does it emit more radiation? And if I shine a light on it, or if I heat it,
does it emit more radiation? Answering these questions would help people
understand what exactly is radiation.

So Marie Curie tried several experiments like this, and she learned that
the variable that had the highest relation to the amount of radiation was
the quantity of material under study. So to predict the amount of
radiation in a sample of uranium, we would measure the amount of uranium.
Other factors were not so important.

This feels like something obvious, but it is quite important! It indicated that
radiation was an intrinsic property of a material, and today we understand
that radiation is the atoms of a material breaking down and emitting energy.

One thing that I really like Marie Curie's story is that she developed
many techniques to study radioactive material. And, this is the important part,
she did not patent those techniques, she shared them with the scientific
community of her time, so that other scientists could also benefit from this
knowledge, and use the techniques to improve the world's understanding of
radioactivity.

So she was one of the early pioneers of Open Data and Open Methods, and
I think this is a very inspiring idea.

==

Another part of Marie Curie's story is that she studied and pioneered
several applications of her research, specially in medicine.

One of her research results is that she observed that
cancer cells died more quickly to radiation than healthy cells.

So this means you could use radiation to treat cancer because
radiation would kill the cancer cells faster than it would kill the
healthy cells.

She helped develop portable X-Ray machines that could be deployed easily.
These machines were used in the First World War, and were called the
"little curies".

Another application of radiation she researched was the use of "Radium Needles"
to sterilize tissues, and avoid infection.

==

Unfortunately, Marie Curie died very young, from problems related to
radiation exposure. This was a fate shared by many researchers of her time
who did not yet know the long term effects of radiation in the human body,
and how to deal with them.

One thing that is kind of interesting is that her research
notebooks are still available. But if you want to read where her
research notebooks you need to wear radiation suit because they
are still very radioactive.

And that's just really amazing to think about.

Anyway, what can we learn from the story of Marie Curie?
And how can it help us think about science, and the role of scientists?

What does it mean to be a scientist? What does it mean to become a scientist?

Of course, I encourage you to think not only of Marie Curie, but of
other people that you think of as "scientists", and consider what makes
them scientists.

How do they develop and talk about their ideas? How do they do
their experiment? How do they contribute to society?

I hope I have some time in future lectures to talk like this about
other scientists and continue this discussion.

==

Anyway, this is the first video about "what is science". I hope you enjoyed it.

In the next video we will continue our discussion about "What is Science",
by looking at two historical scientific experiments, as well as
a very interesting description of science by the Museum of
Palenteology of California.

See you there!
