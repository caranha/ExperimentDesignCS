Hello Everyone, I'm Claus Aranha from the University of
Tsukuba, and this is Experiment Design for Computer Sciences.

In this video I will continue the discussion about
"What is Science". There is a lot to talk about it, so let's go.

==

In this video, I want to focus our discussion on two
historical scientific discoveries --
The discovery of Cosmic Background Radiation,
and the discovery of how to prevent Scurvy.

After this I also want to talk about Science in a wider context.

==

So let's talk about Cosmic Background Radiation.

A lot of researchers in physics are very interested in discovering
how the universe works, and how it began.

Physicists look at the light of galaxies far away, which give us
information about the start of the universe, and use this information
to build theories about how the universe began.

One of the most well supported theories is the "inflation" theory,
which says that in the beginning, the universe was composed of very
dense, hot plasma.

Then in the first instants of the universe, space expanded very
quickly, cooling the plasma and leading to the current composition
of the universe.

So, why is this theory well supported? How do we know that this
theory is a good description of the first moments of the universe?

==

Well, it turns out that data from some very interesting experiments
support the predictions made by Inflation theory.

One of these experiments is the observation of "Cosmic Background Radiation"
(CBR). What is this?

Well, CBR was actually discovered by accident. Initially they thought that
it was noise in astronomy instruments. The astronomers that were trying
to clear this noise ended up discovering that the noise was everywhere
at the same time, and had no clear source! (In fact, you can see this
noise in very old analog TVs).

Anyway, analyzing this noise, physicists found that the distribution of
frequencies in the CBR match very precisely the predictions made by
Inflation theory.

So we have a theory that is initially created by the observation of
the speed of galaxies moving away from us, which indicates that the
universe is expanding, and that this expansion was very fast in the beginning.

And then after that we obtain data that confirms this fast initial expansion,
because of the distribution of different frequencies.

So this example shows us how we can use data that we collect from nature
to understand our world a little better, to understand how the universe works.

==

The other historical research that I want to talk about is very different.

It is not about finding knowledge about things that happened billions of years
in the past. This example is a much more applied version of science.

Let's talk about the British Empire in the 18th Century. Ships sailing on
oceans across the entire world, plundering the treasures of many different
countries.

So the fleet was very important for the British, but on long boat trips
there was this disease that affected many sailors. The disease is Scurvy,
also known as the rotting disease.

I want to tell the story of James Lind, a doctor who found out how to
prevent Scurvy in long sea voyages.

==

So, the question in James Lind's mind was: How could we prevent
scurvy from happening in the sailors, so that they could work in longer
voyages, spend less time sick, etc?

In that time, there were many theories about why scurvy worked, and how
it could be treated, but no one really knew which ideas worked, and
which ideas didn't.

So James Lind designed an experiment to try these ideas. The key idea
was that Scurvy caused the body to rot, and one way to prevent rot is to
use acidic substances.

So Lind developed an experiment where he gave a different "food supplement"
to groups of sailors affected by the disease. It is interesting to think
about how he chose these supplements. Vinegar, Oranges and Lemons are acidic,
as in the original idea, then sea water and vitriol are "neutral" choices,
while Tea... well, it is the British Navy.

Anyway, he observed the greatest effect on the group that had Oranges and
Lemons, and a smaller effect on the group that had Cider. After this
experiment, the British Navy ordered all ships to carry limes in their
food ratios, to help prevent scurvy among the crew.

Today we know that Scurvy is caused by Vitamin C deficiency, and we
can understand the results of this experiment better.

So in the end, even if the original idea, that Scurvy was the body rotting,
and that acid would cure the disease, was wrong, this experiment allowed
Lind to discover something very useful and practical.

==

These two experiments start to show us a framework for scientific thought.

Although these two experiments were very different, they illustrate a very
common idea of science. The idea that we obtain information through
experiments, and this information helps us support or reject hypothesis
that describe our knowledge.

This leads to this description of the scientific method, that maybe
you saw in high school or college:

- Observe a phenomenom;
- Propose a hypothesis;
- Perform an experiment;
- Draw conclusions;

So, is this a good description of what is science?

==

This description of the scientific method is not wrong,
but it is incomplete. It is a kind of straw man of science.

What is the problem with this description?

First, it does not explain where the question and hypothesis
come from. For example, in the case of scurvy, the acid hypothesis
came from the background knowledge, and the need of the navy.
Aren't these things part of the science as well?

Same thing with the inflation theory, which came from another
anterior research, which is the third point -- the scientific
process is not something with a beginning and an end, but something
that continues and continues.

We can see some other limitations here, like the role of other
scientists in the process, and the idea that the knowledge generated
by science changes over time.

So let's try to build a better framework to describe science.

==

So a better description of science describes the process not
as something with a clear beginning and end, but as a continuous
process.

A kind of infinite state machine, with many actors, and many possible
paths and feedback circles. Let's take a closer look on this.

==

So this structure describes science as an interactive process
that involves several actors.

Each time we have a scientific discovery, we walk through a different
path in this framework, and this walk can go back and forth, starting
and ending in different places.

For example, you can begin from a idea that came from the scientific
society and end in a industrial application. Or maybe you begin from
a personal curiosity, and tested the idea again and again, and finally
gave this idea back to the community.

So this framework, which of course is not complete, describes
science as a living, complex organism. Let's take a closer look at this
framework.

==

We will begin here at this entry point in the top, named exploration
and discovery.

Here we have many traditional ways where new ideas are generated.
These new ideas can come from curiosities, or problems that we want
to solve. Sometimes they come from a surprising observation that you
want to know more about.

Now, this initial spark is not everything. After the spark,
you have several things that you can do about it, like sharing it with
other people, or reading about the spark in the literature to learn more,
or asking more questions. This will lead you to the next step.

==

So after we have an idea, and we cooked this idea in our head for a while,
we come to the part of the process that most people associate with science,
which is testing that idea.

And it is interesting here that this part of the process is divided in
two parts: Gathering the data and Interpreting the data. This division is
very important.

If we look at the "Gathering data" part, we see what we normally expect
from the "scientific method": Hypothesis, expected results, and actual results.

But that is just half of the story. The other half is how we react to this
data -- maybe the data supports our idea, or maybe it contradicts our idea.
This will guide new experiments and tests! So we go back and forth here
many times, getting data and interpreting data, and getting more data, etc.

At some point, we leave this circle, and in this framework a lot of things can
happen after you gather and interpret data. For example, your test can
give you a new idea, so you could go back to the top area.

Or maybe you decide to share your results with the community, and
this lead us to the next section of the framework.

==

This is a very important part of the framework, the scientific community.

Here is where you publish your paper, but remember that publishing a paper
is just a formal way to share your ideas with other people.

But you can also engage with the scientific community by talking to other
scientists, and by helping them replicate your results. Here is also
where peer review happens.

One important point is the role of the interaction with the scientific
community. This interaction allows you to view your ideas and data from
new points of view, and this can bring you back to the "testing idea" stage,
or even give you new ideas to think about.

The community can also help you keep yourself motivated, or help you
get out of certain dead-ends. So I think it is very important for
you to build your connections with the scientific community as soon
as you can. Remember, you are already part of the scientific community,
so act like it!

==

The final part of this frameworks is when we transform scientific ideas and
data into concrete benefits and outcomes.

So at first, this looks like an "end point" of this framework. You can
see that we have here, "new technologies" and "policies", and even
"satisfy curiosity".

But it is good to note that this is not necessarily the end,
because science is really about how we interact with the world.

So if a scientific experiment led to a new technology, this technology
can create new situations in society that require further research. For
example, we can think of the car, that not only changed society, but
generated whole new fields of research about it.

==

So, to summarize this video, the key idea is that
science is not a limited series of steps.

Science is something living, a method, a way of thinking, and a community.

I highly recommend that you read more about these ideas at the
"Understanding Science" webpage, which is linked in the "related links"
in manaba. It is very easy to follow through, and has many interesting
examples.

However, when you look at that page, and when we think about the philosophy
of science in general, it is interesting to think that the discussion usually
assumes fields like chemistry or biology, but how does computer science
fits in this conversation? This is a question that I want to bring
back again and again in this course.

Anyway, this is the end of this video, and in the next video I want to
focus on what was the center of the framework that I introduced to you.

What is experimentation, and how it fits with the concepts of science that
we have discussed so far.

See you there!
