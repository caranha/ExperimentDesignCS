\begin{frame}[t]{Lecture Outline}
  In today's class, I want to cover some key concepts for the course: 
  \medskip

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is an experiment;
    \item What is the role of experiments in science;
    \item Why experiments have to be \structure{designed};
  \end{enumerate}
  \bigskip

  In future lectures we will cover techniques related to the 
  design and analysis of experiments, but the lecture today will be more conceptual. We will discuss WHY we want to do all these things.
  \bigskip

  Knowing the {\bf WHY} is important to motivate the {\bf WHAT}.
