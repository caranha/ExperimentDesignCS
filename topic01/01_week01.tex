\subsection{Class Summary}
\begin{frame}{Summary of the Lecture}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Experimentation is a key part of Science;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Experiments acquires data that can be used to validate or falsify scientific ideas, and to answer scientific questions;
    \end{itemize}
    \bigskip

    \item An experiment has to be performed carefully to guarantee its usefulness;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf Experimental design} defines the type of experiment, and how data is gathered;
      \item Several factors can affect the {\bf fairness and meaningfulness} of experiments;
      \item {\bf Reproducibility} is essential to guarantee the usefulness of an experiment;
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Report 01}
\begin{frame}{Report 1}{Design and execute a scientific experiment, and report your results}

  For this report, you must choose a simple experiment to design, perform, and analyze the results. Your report should consist of:\medskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Introduction}: Describe your scientific question, its relevance, and why do you need an experiment for it;
    \item {\bf Experiment Design}: Describe how you will collect data to answer your scientific question; Make sure to mention any parameters or factors that must be controlled;
    \item {\bf Data Collection:} Report on your data collection, if anything happened outside of expected from the experimental design;
    \item {\bf Analysis:} Describe your results in detail, and what answer they provide to your scientific question;
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{alertblock}{}
    \alert{Remember to follow practices of {\bf reproducible science}}
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Report 1}{How to choose an experiment for your report}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If possible, choose something from your own research;
    \medskip

    \item Experiments from your day to day life are also good;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Comparing cooking techniques is always fun;
      \item When collecting data, be careful of measuring errors;
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    \item When in doubt, comparing algorithms is an easy choice;
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Make sure to choose an appropriate metric to report!
    \end{itemize}
    \medskip

    \item Make sure you choose an experiment that you can perform!
    \bigskip

    \item Next lecture, we will talk about a bit about how to analyze and report experimental data;
  \end{itemize}
