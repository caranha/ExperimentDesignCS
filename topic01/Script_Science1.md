Hello everyone, I'm Klaus and welcome
to the first week of experiment
designs and computer science.
So let's get to it.
Today's this week's lecture will
be divided in three videos.
In the first one,
I'm going to talk about what is science?
The second one about experimentalism,
and the third one I'm going to talk a
little bit about ball to report number one.
So let's go to the first part.
What is science?
Everyone here is in the Masters in computer
Science degree course, so at the end,
after you defeat defend your thesis,
you're going to get a diploma saying that
you are a master in computer science.
What does that mean?
I usually start the course asking
students what do you think is science?
What is science for you?
Unfortunately this time I cannot ask
you and have a discussion about it.
So here are some things that
students from past years said.
So some students said,
like Science is a method
to learn about the world,
or science is a method to reach the truth.
Science is useful when it contributes
to society or science is how we
develop new technologies and.
Many other question, any other ideas?
It's good.
I mean it's good to have your own ideas,
and since we cannot have a discussion,
if you want to post your answer on my number,
that would be really nice.
So anyway. What is science?
Let's not answer the question.
OK,
the truth is that all this did answers
that the students said in the less
likely they are kind of correct.
Actually,
science is a word that may mean
different things to different
people depending on the background,
like what a person who entered in
sociology started thinking about
science might be different for
someone who is doing mathematics
things about science.
But of course even these different
ways to look at says they have
some common characteristics.
That we are going to explore in this course.
1st,
it's usually we consider that
science includes the discovery of
new knowledge and understanding
of the natural world and a focus
on correctness and methodology.
And we're going to talk in more
detail about what this means
in the following slides.
However,
there are some things that are
also not often discussed when
we say discuss what is science,
for example, science is actually
not a think but a community.
Different people exchanging ideas,
communicating and working
together to a common goal.
That's that's one way to
see what size is right.
The cyantific community.
Also, science is a continuous process.
Science is not something that exists
or that is ended or that ends.
It's a way of thinking.
It's a way of.
Doing things with the objective of
acquiring new knowledge about the world.
Also, a science does not exist in a vacuum.
Science exist in relation to the society.
OK,
this society guides what science is
doing and science is also change how
society interacts with the world.
So the relationship between society
science scientists very important.
So. In all of these.
OK, so is there an answer?
What is science?
One way that I really like to do
you understand what is science
is to look at people that say oh.
That's a scientist that someone that
I want to be inspired about OK,
and that's something that I also ask like
to ask the students in the first class,
like who are the scientists that inspire you?
OK, when you think about the scientist?
Who do you think about? Why are you
doing that master computer science?
Did you have everything?
I want to be a scientist when
you talk about that.
Who was in your mind?
OK, it's very important to have heroes.
It's something that it's you can use to like.
Think about how you want to be the future.
Of course, these heroes change overtime,
but that's a different conference story,
so let's talk about one person that
I think it's a very good example
of how we think about science,
and it's mighty create OK.
So who is mighty?
Queer Media was born in Poland.
She did most of her size in France,
so that's why usually people
use her French name.
Her Poland name is actually Maria,
not Maria.
She was born in 87, six,
seven and she died in 1934,
so she died quite young.
She was a physicist and chemist.
She was a pioneer of radioactivity,
so she did a lot of research about what
we understand today to be radioactivity.
OK,
she was the first woman to win over price.
She was the only woman to win
the Nobel Prize 2 times and she
was the only person men or women.
Win the Nobel Prize in two different fields,
one in physics, one in chemistry.
I always like.
When talking about scientists,
start by talking about who they were
before they started doing research, right?
It's really interesting to
see where people come from,
so might equally as I said before,
she was born in Portland,
and it was interesting that she wanted
to enroll into a local University,
but she could not.
Because the universities in the place
where she live did not accept women,
they've invested time only accepted men.
So she rolled in what is called
a flying University.
So the flying University was a
clandestine University at the time that was.
Sponsored by some private individuals,
exactly for trying to.
Rise up people who would
not have normally access,
so it's really good to see.
Like in this like 2 centuries ago,
this initiatives to try to give more
access to people through knowledge.
See how important it is right?
Why, I wonder if we wouldn't have,
like maybe created her discoveries
if it was not for this initiative.
She had to work as a tutor and as
a home teacher to sustain herself.
So if you're a T8 this year or next year,
you can see a little bit of
Mercury on yourself
as well. OK, so she moved to Paris to earn
a physics degree when she started and
for most of her research life she had.
She worked in some very very.
How do you say simple conditions?
She worked in a shed and she did really
had a lot of resource to get students
and all the researchers to work her.
So she had a lot of difficulty
finding research money.
I'm not going to go into a lot of detail,
but I really highly recommend that
you found like some podcasts or maybe
look on Wikipedia to learn a little
bit more about Mary queer Life.
It's an interesting weather difficulties
that she had to perform her experience.
So talking a little bit about her research.
OK, so in my equally a time there was a
lot of interest there doll of people who
were studied had radioactive materials.
And the questions that they have is
like they knew that radiation existed.
But WHI did this material emit radiation?
And how did they remit is?
It's something that the materials
required hours it a natural property.
Does it change over time?
What exactly was radiation
and what could we use it for?
So these were some of the questions
that were interested that interest
might create like she knew that some
materials like uranium they had.
They admitted this energy,
but what was it and what could we use it for?
And how can we understand it better?
One of her earliest significant discoveries
is that the quantity of radiation
depends only on the amount of material.
So what she asked is like, OK.
How can we change the quantity of radiation?
Like if I hit this stone,
does it emit more radiation?
Whole Uranus turn?
Does it emit more radiation
than a broken one?
If I put radiation in one stone,
we will admit radiation pack and what
she discovered is that she tried many
different experiments and the one thing
that seems to be the highest variable,
equal truly how much radiation came from
Uranian was how much uranium there was so?
The proposed date amount of partition
was proportional to the amount of
material and that indicated to her
that radiation was an innate property
of the material that she was studying.
It was not something that it was acquired
or it was activated or anything like that.
OK, so that was something that she
learned through experimentation.
One thing that is really,
really cool.
I really,
really like about Marie Curie's
story is that she developed many
techniques to study radioactive
material and she did not attend.
And of course there was already
patents in that in that time.
But she thought that by not pretending
than other scientists could also use
their techniques and the development
and understanding of radioactivity
would progress much faster so.
He was one of the early pioneers of
data science and I also am a very
enthusiastic about open data and they
opened open data and open methods.
So I think this is really inspiring
to see like this big famous
scientists also yeah,
and I mean we need to share more
information to develop site better.
So one thing is that also Marie
Curie applied a lot of her research,
especially to medicine.
So first is wanting that working.
It was one another of her research
results is that she observed that
two more cells from cancer died more
quickly to radiation than healthy cells.
So you could use radiation to treat
cancer because it would kill the
cancer cells more quickly than
it would kill the healthy cells.
She also. I mean she did not develop.
** was already developed at the time,
but she developed machines that
were that could do X Rays that
were portable and she diploid.
These machines on World War One.
So she participated in the First World War.
By preparing these machines and moving
dinner out and trying to develop ways
to do treatments based on radiation
portably in the in the battlefields,
these were called a little curious.
So they were like kind of endless
that that move around it there also.
She developed radium needles so
they use of radiation to sterilize
tissue to avoid infection.
OK.
Unfortunately,
and I think this would come to
no surprise to anyone.
But Marie Curie died very early
from radiation damage and a lot of
researchers in her time also died
because of radiation because we didn't
know at the time that radiation was
dangerous for the human body in long term.
And one thing that is kind of
interesting is that her research
notebooks are still available.
But if you want to read where her
research notebooks you need to wear
radiation suit because her service and
research notebooks are still radioactive.
And that's just really amazing.
So this is something to think about.
What can you learn from from
this story of my recreate?
What can you think about that?
What it is to be a scientist?
Think also like what are the
scientists that you know?
How did they do their science well?
How did they do experiments?
How did they come to their ideas?
I'm going to try to talk about
a few more scientists on this
lecture and in other lectures,
and I think it's really important for us
to think about the centive communities
and the works that inspired us in this.
Communities.
OK, so let's talk a little
bit of what is science OK?
We're going to 1st discuss 2
examples of interesting and
different scientific discoveries,
the cosmic background radiation
and citrus fruit and scurvy.
But we're going to do that on the next video,
so take a little break and I see you soon.
