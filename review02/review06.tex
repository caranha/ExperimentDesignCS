\section{06 -- Sample Size Calculation}

\begin{frame}[t]{Topic 06 -- Sample Size Calculation}
  The amount of data that we must collect from an experiment is an important
  decision for the experiment design stage:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sample size has a large influence on the power and confidence of an experiment;
    \item On the other hand, larger samples incur in large experimental costs;
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  Power calculations for statistical tests can be used to estimate the desired sample size of an experiment;
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fix the sample size and estimate the power of an experiment;
    \item Fix the power and estimate the sample size;
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  Power calculations usually require an estimate for the variance of the model. This value can be obtained from domain knowledge or a preliminary experiment;\bigskip

  The power calculation for the ANOVA also depends on the strategy for ad-hoc testing;
