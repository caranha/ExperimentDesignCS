\section{07 -- Factorial Analysis}

\begin{frame}[t]{Topic 07 -- Factorial Analysis}
  Variables of an experiment:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Controlled Factors; Factor Levels;
    \item Noise Factors / Nuisance Factors; (see Blocking and Pairing)
    \item Random noise / Background Noise / Residual Noise;
    \item Response Variable;
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  When an experiment has more than one controlled factor, we are interested in possible {\bf interaction effects} between those factors.\bigskip

  If we don't expect strong interaction effects, we can use "One Variable At a Time" (OVAT) design. OVAT analyses each controlled factor in a different experiment.\bigskip

  Factorial Design treats every combination of factors as a different level of a "unified" factor. In this model ANOVA can be used to identify interaction effects.
