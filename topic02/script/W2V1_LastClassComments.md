# Survey Result Discussion
- 54 students answered the survey. This is a very big group, maybe the
biggest class in this course until now?

- 10 people did NOT answer their surveys. Please note that submitting this
survey is a requirement to get credit for this course. The survey is NOT
graded, but it counts to your attendance.

- 1 person answered the survey in Japanese. Please make an effort to write
the survey in English. The reports and the exam will be required to be in
English, and the survey can be a good practice for this.

- One person mentioned an "Ignobel Prize" winner as the scientist that they
are inspired by. I want to take a moment to mention that the Ignobel prize
is very cool. It is a prize for research that, at first looks silly, but
when you stop thinking about it, it can be actually very deep. I think
that being silly and playful is an important characteristic for scientists.

- 12 students are taking this class from outside of Japan. I will do my best
so that you can take this course in a good way online.

# Answering questions in Class Feedback
Lots of questions about difficulty with English. I want to thank everybody for
making an effort to take this class. Last week, I said in another class that the
best way to learn a language is to be forced to use it, so I hope you can improve
your English as you take this class. If any part of the class is difficult to
understand, please feel free to ask me anything.

Q: Do you deduct scores for mistakes in English Grammar?

A: No, I do not deduct score for mistakes in English. However, your text still
needs to be clear. If you have difficulty with English, try to write simple
sentences, and focus on the facts of your experiment and data.

Q: Because I don't have much experimental experience, I don't have any clear
ideas about the report to be done soon.

A: There are many things in your life that you can examine by experiment.
How many floors before using the elevator is faster than the stairs?
Do you concentrate more when studying with music or with silence? What is the
fastest way to initialize an array of 0s in Python? Who in your family can
throw a ball the farthest away?

Also please look at the article "101 ways to teach experiments" that is linked
in the PDF for some ideas.

Q: In one research, it's may contain several experiments, and this class will
only cover the experiment not the entire of the research project. Is my
understanding correct?

A: Yes! Your understanding is correct. In the first class, we took some
time to talk about science in general terms. But, for the rest of the course,
we will focus on "one experiment". As you said, a research project usually
includes several experiments.

Q: I googled geocaching after reading it on your slides, and find it looks so fun!

A: Please try geocaching, it is a fun and healthy hobby!
