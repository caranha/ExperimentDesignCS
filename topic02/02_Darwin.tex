    \begin{itemize}
      \item Well known for his theory on \structure{the origin of species}
      \item His theory correctly predicted the hereditary nature of evolution, even before genes were known.
      \item Actually, in his period, many people were interested in understanding the origin of the species;

  \begin{itemize}
    \item In 1837, his notes from the Beagle's trip gave him his first insights about how "one species transforms into another"
    \item He gathered more and more data to confirm his theory, from marine biologists, farmers and breeders, plants, etc.
    \item This task of cataloguing and experimenting took over 15 years;
    \item Eventually published "On The Origin of the Species" in 1859, by encouragement from his friend scientists;
