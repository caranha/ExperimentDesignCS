# 2021:
- Talk about other important point estimators: Variance, Correlation

# Improve sample code:
- change "example" RMD models to have analysis goals, and focus the code into
achieving those goals.
- Add a code example about the "Central Limit Theorem" and show how it works.

# Improve interval indicator part, which is too technical
- This part is too technical. Add a concrete example of the Confidence Interval, with actual numbers, when explaining what it is.
- the explanation of $z$ and $t$ comes out of nowhere in the definition of CI. This part needs to be broken down a bit more.

- Add some part about data visualization (types of graphs for indicators)
  - Maybe in a separate lecture?
