# TODO:

## TODO 2023
- Add example/discussion about other important point and interval estimators:
  - Variance
  - Correlation

- Add a video with sample R code about intervals (CI, etc)
  - Include code to visualize estimators and intervals.
  - Talk about visualization.

- Separate the discussion of the central limit theorem to its own video.
  - Talk in more detail why it is important, and add references.
  - Add a code example about CLT

- Add example (with data/problem) about variance and correlation estimators

# General TODO
## Improve interval indicator part
- This part is too technical. Add a concrete motivating example
  in the beginning, with actual numbers.

- the explanation of $z$ and $t$ comes out of nowhere in the
  definition of CI. This part needs to be broken down a bit more.
- The explanation of confidence interval could probably be extended
  a bit.
- Code and examples could be added.

## Data visualization
- Add some discussion about data visualization
  (visualisation of estimators (tables) and intervals (graphs))
- Reference links for Data visualization?
  Break this to another lecture?

## Code Video
- Think about the structure of the "Code Video",
- Maybe add a better example with context, describing the initial
  experiment used to gather data, and the R code used to calculate
  things. Introduce RMD later.
- Find a good link for data wrangling with R
