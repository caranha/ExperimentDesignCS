Comparison of conversion of image from Raw to PNG/TIFF

The idea of the comparison between image formats is interesting.  Please think about the following questions:

- Do you care about the result of this experiment? Why?
- Does the content of the image affect the result of the experiment? How? How can you control the effect of the contents of the pictures? What kind of pictures are you interested in?
- Why did you choose 3 pictures?
- Why did you choose the 5% difference?


## Point 1: Choose an experiment that you care about

If you don't care about the question/answer of your experiment, it will be very hard to do a good experiment. 
- You won't be able to imagine what results are important or irrelevant; 
- You will not be able to think about the factors that can influence the experiment. 
- You will not be able to decide which factors to fix or vary; and the parameters of variation.

## Point 2: The output variable

The Output variable is the result of your experiment. It is the value that you are interested in observing.

When you think about the output variable, consider the characteristics of this variable.
  - Is the variable discrete or continuous?
  - What is the range of values for this variable? What are the typical values?
  - What is the typical variation for this variable?
  - What is the size of difference that is important for you and for your experimental question?
  
The answer to some of the questions above may come from your experience. The answer to some of the questions above can be "I don't know". That is okay, we make experiments and analyse data to find the answers to these questions.

## Point 3: The experimental Factors

The experimental factors are the conditions that could change the result of the experiment.

When you think about each experimental factor, you have to consider their characteristics as well.
  - Are these factors discrete or continuous? 
  - What is the range of possible values? What are the typical values?
  - What is the relationship between the factor and the output variable?
  - What are the values of the factor that interest you?

Based on these characteristics, you should separate the factors as follows:
  - Factors that you will study in the experiment. These factors you will set to specific values, because you are interested in the influence of these factors in the outcome of the output variable.
  - Factors that you want to control in the experiment. These factors have important influence in the output variable, but you do not want to study their influence. So you will have to fix their value during the experimental design, or limit their effect using techniques such as pairing (studied in class) or blocking (not studied in class)
  - Other factors, that you cannot control, but you can estimate their influence in the output variable.

## Point 4: Expected results

It is helpful to try to predict what is the expected result of the experiment before you execute the experiment. When you learn the result, you can more clearly define if the result confirmed your expectations, or revealed something surprising.

By considering the expected result, you can discover if you have missing knowledge about your experiment that you need to study, and if there are parts of the experiment design that are missing.

## Point 5: Choice of Test type, Test parameters, Sample size

## Point 6: Initial experiment and Descriptive statistics

## Point 7: Statistical test analysis and conclusions

## Point Extra: Ethical Research
- Iris dataset: 
  - Very used in ML
  - Not really an interesting dataset
  - Originally published in the "Annals of Eugenics"
  - Consider the origins of your dataset. 
  - More complex issues, such as equality, etc.
