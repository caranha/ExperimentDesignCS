Things that happened in lectures/reports, that I need to make clearer in the next course.



- Some students think that submit code means including screenshots of jupyter notebooks in their pdfs. Need to make clear that this is not acceptable: Code and data must be submitted as separate files.

- In cases where the data is available online, it needs to be explained where, how to obtain, and conditions for use, as well as any pre-processing that was done.

- **I probably need an entire lecture about reproducible research**


- Maybe three reports are too much
  - Two reports and one case study or one exam would be better?
  - Exam should include "hidden curriculum" and interpretation
    of text in papers (but I need to include these in class)
  - Japanese style ethical exams

- Idea: paired vs non paired: Use the example of testing a clustering
  NN method with different features. First it is tested on a sinlge
  dataset (unpaired), then explain that this test does not generalize,
  and a paired test on multiple datasets would be much better.

- Idea: Add self exercises (questions and exercise sheets) for
  students to test their own knowledge about the topics.
